Noise in the Machine is the second EP from British Darkwave band Massive Ego. The debut release on the band's new label Out of Line Music, on 24 July 2015. It marked a departure from the old Euro dance sound of the band. It features remixed versions of I Idolize You, Dead Silence and Generation V done by new band member Lloyd Price (Frixion), Aesthetic Perfection and Leæther Strip, as well as the Zarkoff remix of Low Life.
Lloyd Price joined Massive Ego in 2015 after had departed from his previous band Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Price had done the Modification Remix for the I Idolize You single in 2011, which was the beginning of the new musical direction of the band. A new edit was done for I Idolize You, as well as remixes from Daniel Graves (Aesthetic Perfection) and Claus Larsen (Leæther Strip). Generation V, previously released on Fuel for the Machine (2013) was remixed by Frixion, Price's side-project. Additional vocals were recorded for Dead Silence, a single by Lia Organa & Electric Prince which featured Marc Massive on Vocals, and was reworked to become Dead Silence Rising.

Det bästa med Karin och Anders Glenmark is the third album by brother sister group Gemini, released in 2005. Unlike their previous two albums, Det bästa med Karin och Anders Glenmark is more of a compilation featuring tracks from their previous two albums with remastered sound along with a few rarities.
One song that caught attention was the previously unreleased "When I Close My Eyes", a song intended for their first album but was subsequently left off as being too similar to the song "Another You, Another Me", a composition already included on the album. Also of note is the inclusion of the Swedish version of "Too Much Love Is Wasted", entitled "Den som sa det var det". This version of the song isn't merely the English version with Swedish lyrics. The Swedish version was produced in a country style and adds a depth that is lacking on the English version.
Pardomima zanclophora is a moth in the Crambidae family. It was described by Martin in 1955. It is found on the Comoros (Mohéli, Mayotte, Grande Comore) and the Seychelles (Assomption, Aldabra), as well as in the Democratic Republic of Congo (North Kivu, Equateur, Katanga), Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Saudi Arabia.
Libagao is an island located in the Antique province of the Philippines. In 1919 its elevation was recorded at 240 feet (73 m), and at this time it was noted that the island had a few inhabitants, was "covered with low, dark scrubby trees" and was "fringed by reefs." At this time it was noted that three summits exist on the eastern area of the island and that the island's western area is "a low, flat sandy point."

NHS Resolution, the operating name of NHS Litigation Authority, is an arm's length body of the Department of Health. It changed its name in April 2017.
The organisation's purpose is to provide expertise to the NHS on resolving concerns fairly, share learning for improvement and preserve resources for patient care.
The main bulk of NHS Resolution's workload is handling negligence claims on behalf of the members of the indemnity schemes: NHS organisations and independent sector providers of NHS care in England.
Existing Liabilities Scheme (ELS) is centrally funded by the Department of Health and covers clinical negligence claims against NHS organisations for incidents occurring before 1 April 1995
Ex-RHA Scheme (Ex-RHAS) is a relatively small scheme, centrally funded by the Department of Health, covering clinical negligence claims against former Regional Health Authorities abolished in 1996
DH clinical covers clinical negligence liabilities that have transferred to Department of Health following the abolition of any relevant health bodies
In addition the one other non clinical scheme is DH non-clinical which covered non-clinical liabilities that have transferred to the Department of Health following the abolition of any relevant health bodies
the Family Health Services Appeal Unit handles disputes between doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists and NHS England) since April 2005.
The overhaul announced by Jeremy Hunt in March 2017 is intended to shift emphasis away from claim management to proactive, earlier interventions to support families, particularly in maternity cases. There will be a specialist early intervention team focussed on brain injuries at birth.
In 2004-5 the authority dealt with 5,609 claims of clinical negligence and 3,766 of non-clinical negligence. About 38% of claims are abandoned by the claimant, and about 43% are settled out of court. In 2004-5 £502.9 million was paid out in respect of clinical negligence claims, and £25.1 million in respect of non-clinical negligence. By 2015/6 payments (which include defence and claimants' legal costs) had risen to more than £1.4 billion, although new claims in that year fell by 4.6%. It often takes several years to resolve claims. Claims may be submitted many years after the event. The biggest element of compensation is the cost of caring for children who suffer brain injury at birth. There is no time limit on these claims.
It runs the clinical negligence scheme for trusts. All NHS trusts in England are members of the scheme. They paid £968m in contributions in 2013-14 an increase of 38% since 2009. In principle trusts can insure themselves in the commercial market, but none have yet done so, possibly because leaving the scheme would crystallise their outstanding liabilities. The authority altered the scheme in 2014 to give greater weight to trusts claims history when setting contributions.
In 2012/3 charges amounted to £3,778,000. 47.59% related to maternity, 21.45% to surgery, 15.65% to medicine, 7.83% to A&E and 7.48% to all other specialities. Clinical negligence charges amounted to 23% of the cost of maternity services in England.
The Department of Health’s triennial review of the Authority in 2015 reported that it took an average of 2.7 years for claims to be reported and a further 1.31 years for claims to be resolved.
It was established in 1995 as a special health authority. Its current duties are established under the National Health Service Act 2006. Since its foundation it has managed about 160,000 clinical negligence claims.
The National Clinical Assessment Service became part of the NHS Litigation Authority on 1 April 2013, taking the headcount of employees at the NHS LA to over 200 people.
Mr Ian Dilks is chair of NHS Resolution, having taken up his appointment on 1 April 2014 for a three-year term of office, which was extended on 1 April 2017 for a further two years till 1 April 2019. He succeeded Dame Joan Higgins who was appointed in 2007.
Nadine Muriel, Countess of Shrewsbury (neé Crofton 24 January 1913 – 2003), known professionally as Nadine Talbot and later as Nadine Credi, was an English opera soprano and the first wife of John Chetwynd-Talbot, 21st Earl of Shrewsbury (1914–1980). They married in 1936.
Lord Shrewsbury sued for divorce in 1958, claiming that Nadine had been sexually involved with their daughters' tutor Anthony Lowther, but in 1959 judge Charles A. Collingwood rejected the divorce suit, finding that Lord Shrewsbury had committed adultery with Nina Mortlock. In a subsequent proceeding, a divorce was granted.
Nadine and Lord Shrewsbury had six children. They had four daughters before the birth of an heir, Charles. He succeeded to the earldoms in 1980.

Mečislovas or Mečys Gedvilas (October 19, 1901 – February 15, 1981) was a Lithuanian politician who collaborated with occupying Soviet forces. He served as the first Prime Minister of the Lithuanian SSR from 1940 to 1956.
Born at Bubiai in Kovno Governorate in 1901, Gedvilas and his family were deported to Russia for violation of the Lithuanian press ban in 1904. Gedvilas studied at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology from 1919 to 1922. After returning to Lithuania he worked as a teacher in Palanga (1923–1927) and as a director of state patient fund in Telšiai (1928–1940). He was active in various left-wing political organizations and publications. For these activities he was briefly jailed several times by the authoritarian regime of Antanas Smetona. Troubles with the law enforcement brought Gedvilas closer to the communist activists. After the Soviet ultimatum in June 1940, Gedvilas became Minister of Internal Affairs in the People's Government and was elected to the People's Seimas. He helped to transition Lithuania into the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, thus legitimizing the Soviet occupation.
Gedvilas served as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of Lithuania (in 1946 renamed to the Council of Ministers) from August 25, 1940 to January 16, 1956 (equivalent to Prime Minister). In this capacity he signed off on persecution orders, including the mass deportation of Lithuanians into gulags and other forced settlements. From 1952 to 1956, he was a candidate to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Gedvilas was demoted to Minister of Education due to tensions and political rivalry between him and Antanas Sniečkus, the first secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party. Gedvilas is credited for rebuilding a number of schools and introducing eleven-year secondary education. He retired from the ministry in 1973. Gedvilas was a delegate of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR in 1940–1975 and of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1941–1962. In 1975, he published a memoir book Lemtingas posūkis (The Fateful Change), which was translated into Russian in 1979. The book contained essays and speeches regarding World War II (1940–1945).

In Hinduism, Vaishvanara (Sanskrit: वैश्वानर, pronounced [ʋəiɕʋaːnərə]), meaning "of or related to Visvanara" is an abstract concept related to the soul atman. Etymologically, Vaishvanara is a derivative of the conjoined word Vishvanara i.e. Vishva (Universe) + Narah (Man) i.e. the 'Universal or Cosmic Man'. In the Rig Veda, Vaishvanara is an epithet of deity Agni.
As per the Mandukya Upanishad, the Self has four aspects or states of consciousness. The first is the Vaishvanara manifestation, under the jagrat or the waking state which is outwardly cognitive. The Self in Vaishvanara form has seven limbs, nineteen mouths and has the capability to experience material objects.
The seven limbs of Vaishvanara pertain to the ‘cosmic body’ of ‘Vaishvanara’. These are enumerated in verse 18.2 of the Chandogya Upanishad,
[T]he heavens are his head, the sun his eyes, the air his breath, the fire his heart, the water his stomach, the earth his feet, and space his body.
The seven limbs of Vaishvanara have also referred to in the first verse of the Mandukya Upanishad, which have been described to encompass the entire manifest universe. The nineteen “mouths” are
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.
Lake Atitlán (Spanish: Lago de Atitlán, [atiˈtlan]) is a lake in the Guatemalan Highlands of the Sierra Madre mountain range. It is in the Sololá Department of southwestern Guatemala. Atitlan means "at the water" in Nahuatl.
Lake Atitlán is a lake in Central America with a maximum depth of about 340 metres (1,120 ft) with an average depth of 220 metres (720 ft). Its surface area is 130.1 km2 (50.2 sq mi). It is approximately 12 by 5 km with around 20 km3 of water. Atitlán is technically an endorheic lake, feeding into two nearby rivers rather than draining into the ocean. It is shaped by deep surrounding escarpments and three volcanoes on its southern flank. The lake basin is volcanic in origin, filling an enormous caldera formed by an eruption 84,000 years ago. The culture of the towns and villages surrounding Lake Atitlán is influenced by the Maya people. The lake is about 50 kilometres (31 mi) west-northwest of Antigua. It should not be confused with the smaller Lake Amatitlán.
Lake Atitlán is renowned as one of the most beautiful lakes in the world, and is Guatemala's most important national and international tourist attraction. German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt called it "the most beautiful lake in the world," and Aldous Huxley famously wrote of it in his 1934 travel book Beyond the Mexique Bay: "Lake Como, it seems to me, touches on the limit of permissibly picturesque, but Atitlán is Como with additional embellishments of several immense volcanoes.

The area supports extensive coffee and avocado orchards and a variety of farm crops, most notably corn and onions. Significant agricultural crops include: corn, onions, beans, squash, tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic, chile verde, strawberries and pitahaya fruit. The lake itself is a significant food source for the largely indigenous population.
The first volcanic activity in the region occurred about 11 million years ago, and since then the region has seen four separate episodes of volcanic growth and caldera collapse, the most recent of which began about 1.8 million years ago and culminated in the formation of the present caldera. The lake now fills a large part of the caldera, reaching depths of up to 600 metres.
The caldera-forming eruption is known as Los Chocoyos eruption and ejected up to 300 km3 (72 cu mi) of tephra. The enormous eruption dispersed ash over an area of some 6 million km²: it has been detected from Florida to Ecuador, and can be used as a stratigraphic marker in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (known as Y-8 ash in marine deposits). A chocoyo is a type of bird which is often found nesting in the relatively soft ash layer.
Since the end of Los Chocoyos, continuing volcanic activity has built three volcanoes in the caldera. Volcán Atitlán lies on the southern rim of the caldera, while Volcán San Pedro and Volcán Tolimán lie within the caldera. San Pedro is the oldest of the three and seems to have stopped erupting about 40,000 years ago. Tolimán began growing after San Pedro stopped erupting, and probably remains active, although it has not erupted in historic times. Atitlán has developed almost entirely in the last 10,000 years and remains active, with its most recent eruption having occurred in 1853.
On February 4, 1976, a very large earthquake (magnitude 7.5) struck Guatemala, killing more than 26,000 people. The earthquake fractured the lake bed and caused subsurface drainage from the lake, allowing the water level to drop two meters within one month.
In 1955, the area around Lake Atitlán became a national park. The lake was mostly unknown to the rest of the world, and Guatemala was seeking ways to increase tourism and boost the local economy. It was suggested by Pan American World Airways that stocking the lake with a fish prized by anglers would be a way to do just that. As a result, an exotic non-native species, the black bass, was introduced into the lake in 1958. The bass quickly took to its new home and caused a radical change in the species composition of the lake. The predatory bass caused the elimination of more than two-thirds of the native fish species in the lake and contributed to the extinction of the Atitlan grebe, a rare bird that lived only in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán.
A unique aspect of the climate is what is referred to as Xocomil (of the Kaqchickel language meaning "the wind that carried away sin"). This wind is common late morning and afternoon across the lake; it is said to be the encounter of warm winds from Pacific meeting colder winds from the North.
In August 2015 a thick bloom of algae known as Microcystis cyanobacteria re-appeared in Lake Atitlan; the first major occurrence was in 2009. Bureaucratic red tape has been blamed for the lack of action to save the lake. If current activities continue unchecked, the toxification of the lake will make it unsuitable for human use.
The lake is surrounded by many villages in which Maya culture is still prevalent and traditional dress is worn. The Maya people of Atitlán are predominantly Tz'utujil and Kaqchikel. During the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the Kaqchikel initially allied themselves with the invaders to defeat their historic enemies, the Tz'utujil and K'iche' Maya, but were themselves conquered and subdued when they refused to pay tribute to the Spanish.
Santiago Atitlán is the largest of the lakeside communities, and it is noted for its worship of Maximón, an idol formed by the fusion of traditional Mayan deities, Catholic saints, and conquistador legends. The institutionalized effigy of Maximón is under the control of a local religious brotherhood and resides in various houses of its membership during the course of a year, being most ceremonially moved in a grand procession during Semana Santa. Several towns in Guatemala have similar cults, most notably the cult of San Simón in Zunil.
While Maya culture is predominant in most lakeside communities, Panajachel, has been overwhelmed over the years by Guatemalan and foreign tourists. It attracted many hippies in the 1960s, and although the civil war caused many foreigners to leave, the end of hostilities in 1996 saw visitor numbers boom again, and the town's economy is almost entirely reliant on tourism today.
Several Mayan archeological sites have been found at the lake. Sambaj, located approximately 55 feet below the current lake level, appears to be from at least the pre-classic period. There are remains of multiple groups of buildings, including one particular group of large buildings that are believed to have been the city center.
A second site, Chiutinamit, where the remains of a city were found, was discovered by local fishermen who "noticed what appeared to be a city underwater". During subsequent investigations, pottery shards were recovered from the site by divers, which enabled the dating of the site to the late pre-classic period (300 B.C. – 300 A.D.), more specifically 250 AD.
A project titled "Underwater archeology in the Lake Atitlán. Sambaj 2003 Guatemala" was recently approved by the Government of Guatemala in cooperation with Fundación Albenga and the Lake Museum in Atitlán. Because of the concerns of a private organization as is the Lake Museum in Atitlán the need to start the exploration of the inland waters in Guatemala was analyzed.
There is no road that circles the lake. Communities are reached by boat or roads from the mountains that may have brief extensions along the shore. Santa Cruz La Laguna and Jaibalito can only be reached by boat. Santa Catarina Palopó and San Antonio Palopó are linked by road to Panajachel. Main places otherwise are Santa Clara La Laguna and San Pedro La Laguna in the West, Santiago Atitlán in the South, Cerró de Oro on The South East and San Lucas Tolimán in the East.
Recent studies indicate that a ceremonial site named Samabaj was located on an island about 500 metres (1,600 ft) long in Lake Atitlán. The site was revered for its striking connection to the Popol Wuj of the K'iche' Mayan peoples.
During the Guatemalan Civil War, the lake was the scene of many terrible human rights abuses, as the government pursued a scorched earth policy. Indigenous people were assumed to be universally supportive of the guerrillas who were fighting against the government, and were targeted for brutal reprisals. At least 300 Maya from Santiago Atitlán are believed to have disappeared during the conflict.
Two events of this era made international news. One was the assassination of Stanley Rother, a missionary from Oklahoma, in the church at Santiago Atitlán in 1981. In 1990, a spontaneous protest march to the army base on the edge of town was met by gunfire, resulting in the death of 11 unarmed civilians. International pressure forced the Guatemalan government to close the base and declare Santiago Atitlán a "military-free zone." The memorial commemorating the massacre was damaged in the 2005 mudslide.
Torrential rains from Hurricane Stan caused extensive damage throughout Guatemala in early October 2005, particularly around Lake Atitlán. A massive landslide buried the lakeside village of Panabaj, causing the death of as many as 1,400 residents, leaving 5,000 homeless, and many bodies buried under tonnes of earth. Following this event, Diego Esquina Mendoza, the mayor of Santiago Atitlán, declared the community a mass gravesite: "Those buried by the mudslide" may never be rescued. Here they will stay buried, under five meters of mud. Panabáj is now a cemetery."
Four and a half years after Hurricane Stan, Tropical Storm Agatha dropped even more rainfall causing extensive damages to the region resulting in dozens of deaths between San Lucas Toliman and San Antonio Palopó. Since then roads have been reopened and travel to the region has returned to normal.

Tai Dam (Chinese: 傣担语; pinyin: Dǎidānyǔ), also known as Black Tai (Thai: ภาษาไทดำ; pronounced [pʰāːsǎː tʰāj dām]; "Black Tai language"; Chinese: 黑傣语; pinyin: Hēidǎiyǔ) is a Tai language spoken by the Tai Dam in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and China (mostly in Jinping Miao, Yao, and Dai Autonomous County).
The Tai Dam language is similar to Thai and Lao, but it is not close enough to be readily understood by most Thai and Lao speakers. In particular, the Pali and Sanskrit additions to Thai and Lao are largely missing from Tai Dam.
Tai Dam speakers in China are classified as part of the Dai nationality along with almost all the other Tai peoples. But in Vietnam they are given their own nationality (with the White Tai) where they are classified (confusingly for English speakers) as the Thái nationality (meaning Tai people).
The Tai Dam language has its own system of writing, called Tai Viet, which consists of 31 consonants and 14 vowels. Although the language is tonal, there are no tone markers, as there are in Tai and Lao. According to Thai authors, the writing system is probably derived from the old Thai writing of the kingdom of Sukhotai.
Proposals to encode Tai Viet script in Unicode go back to 2006. A Unicode subcommittee reviewed a February 6, 2007 proposal submitted by James Brase of SIL International for what was then called Tay Viet script. At the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 meeting on April 24, 2007, a revised proposal for the script, now known as Tai Viet, was accepted "as is", with support from TCVN, the Vietnam Quality & Standards Centre.
The Gunningbland Creek, a perennial river of the Lachlan sub–catchment, part of the Murrumbidgee catchment of the Murray-Darling basin, is located in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia.
The Gunningbland Creek (technically a river) is formed by or near the confluence of the Myall and Box Camp Creeks, west of Parkes, and flows generally west southwest before reaching its confluence with the Goobang Creek, west of Bogan Gate. The creek descends 65 metres (213 ft) over its 54-kilometre (34 mi) course.

Sullivan County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana, and determined by the U.S. Census Bureau to include the mean center of U.S. population in 1940. As of 2010, the population was 21,475. The county seat is Sullivan.
On 25 February 1779 Col. George Rogers Clark captured Fort Sackville at Vincennes from the British. About six miles (10 km) west at Pointe Coupee on the Wabash River on 2 March 1779, Capt. Leonard Helm commanding three boats and 50 volunteers from Vincennes captured a reinforcement fleet of seven boats carrying 40 soldiers and valuable supplies and Indian trade goods. This small naval battle completed the destruction of British military strength in the Wabash Valley.
The county's first settlement occurred between 1808 and 1812, by a religious society of celibates known as Shakers. The 400 members of this communal group occupied 1,300 acres (5 km2), seven miles (11 km) west of Carlisle.
General William Henry Harrison’s army made its last camp in Sullivan County at Big Springs on September 29, 1811. Harrison used Benjamin Turman’s fort as his headquarters. With spring water available, it was an ideal location for 1000 men, including 160 dragoons and 60 mounted riflemen. A Kentucky soldier killed a fellow Kentuckian, Clark, either accidentally or in a grudge fight. The deceased was buried at the top of a hill that became the Mann Turman Cemetery. General Harrison and his troops continued north on the Wea Indiana Trail to build Fort Harrison and then proceeded to the Battle of Tippecanoe.
A War of 1812 military action occurred in September, 1812, three miles (5 km) west/southwest of Sullivan County. While escorting supplies from Fort Knox near Vincennes to Fort Harrison at Terre Haute, Sergeant Nathan Fairbanks and approximately a dozen soldiers were ambushed - and most killed - by Indians.
Sullivan County was formed in 1817. It was named for Daniel Sullivan, said by some sources to have been a Revolutionary War general killed by Native Americans while carrying a dispatch between Fort Vincennes and Louisville.
A log courthouse in Merom served as Sullivan County's first county seat from 1819-1842. Merom was an important river port and a stop on the stage route known as The Old Harrison Trail. William Henry Harrison's troops camped near here on their 1811 march to the Battle of Tippecanoe.
Pioneer heroine of abdominal surgery Jane Todd is buried in Sullivan County. Born in Virginia in 1763, she and her husband, Thomas Crawford, moved to Green County, Kentucky, in 1805. Suffering from a huge abdominal tumor, she rode 60 miles (100 km) to Danville, Kentucky, to submit to an operation never before performed. On December 25, 1809, Dr. Ephraim McDowell performed this, the first ovariotomy, in his home. The ordeal lasted 25 minutes. There was no anesthesia. Mrs. Crawford recovered completely and years later came to Graysville to live with her son, Thomas, a Presbyterian minister. She died in 1842 at age 78. The restored McDowell home in Danville, Kentucky is a surgical shrine.
Dedicated in 1862, Union Christian College served as a preparatory school and college until 1924. In 1936 it became Merom Institute—a rural enrichment center. Now owned by the United Church of Christ, it serves as a camp, conference, and retreat center.
Numerous violent conflicts erupted in Sullivan County during the American Civil War over differing war sentiments. On July 14, 1864, anti-war Democrat John Drake was fatally shot at a community picnic near here.
Organized nationally to bring culture to rural communities, Merom's 10-day religious and educational Chautauqua event featured concerts, debates, plays, and lectures. Carrie Nation, William Jennings Bryan, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding, and Billy Sunday were among the speakers here.
In 1968 Sullivan County Park and Lake was founded. It contains a 468-acre (1.9 km2) reservoir in 1968 for swimming, boating and fishing. The lake is stocked with crappie and hybrid saugeye, as well as bass, bluegill and channel catfish. Water skiing is also very popular. Sullivan County Park and Lake has 400 acres (1.6 km2) of land for camping as well as a 9-hole golf course. The campground offers sites ranging from primitive camping to space for modern motor homes.
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of 454.12 square miles (1,176.2 km2), of which 447.14 square miles (1,158.1 km2) (or 98.46%) is land and 6.97 square miles (18.1 km2) (or 1.53%) is water.
Peabody Energy Corporation The Bear Run mine is the largest surface mine in the eastern U.S. and is expected to produce 12 million tons of coal per year. The mine employs over 500 employees as of April, 2012 and is expected to reach a total of over 700 employees in the next few years. [2]
Sullivan County is served by two school corporations, the Southwest School Corporation and the Northeast School Corporation. The former's high school is Sullivan High School in Sullivan, and the latter's high schools are North Central High School in Farmersburg and Union High School in Dugger. Union Christian College formerly operated in Merom.
In recent years, average temperatures in Sullivan have ranged from a low of 18 °F (−8 °C) in January to a high of 85 °F (29 °C) in July, although a record low of −33 °F (−36 °C) was recorded in January 1994 and a record high of 98 °F (37 °C) was recorded in July 1999. Average monthly precipitation ranged from 2.58 inches (66 mm) in February to 4.69 inches (119 mm) in July.
County Council: The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.
Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.
Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.
County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county.
As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 21,475 people, 7,823 households, and 5,422 families residing in the county. The population density was 48.0 inhabitants per square mile (18.5/km2). There were 8,939 housing units at an average density of 20.0 per square mile (7.7/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 93.7% white, 4.5% black or African American, 0.3% American Indian, 0.2% Asian, 0.3% from other races, and 1.0% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 1.4% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 20.8% were German, 19.8% were American, 10.3% were Irish, and 9.7% were English.
Of the 7,823 households, 31.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.4% were married couples living together, 10.8% had a female householder with no husband present, 30.7% were non-families, and 26.7% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 2.94. The median age was 39.8 years.
The median income for a household in the county was $47,697 and the median income for a family was $52,558. Males had a median income of $44,645 versus $26,335 for females. The per capita income for the county was $20,093. About 8.5% of families and 11.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.9% of those under age 18 and 11.7% of those age 65 or over.
Type 366 is the Chinese development of Russian MR-331 Mineral-ME naval radar (NATO reporting name: Band Stand), and as late of 2010’s, it is the latest and most advanced surface search radar of the Chinese navy.
MR-331 Mineral-ME radar system consists of Mineral-ME1 active radar and Mineral-ME2 passive radar mounted in a back-to-back configuration, and Mineral-ME3 mutual data exchange, navigation and joint combat operation control station, Mineral-ME radar system is designed to detect, track and record (including over-the-horizon) surface targets, provide and receive information to and from other sources. Typical detection range against a destroyer sized target in the active mode in up to 250 km, while that of the passive mode ranges from 80 to 450 km. Active and passive subsystems of MR-331 Mineral-ME can operate in conjunction. MR-331 Mineral-ME is installed on Sovremennyy-class destroyer sold to China, and China also purchased additional sets for its own destroyers.
China was thoroughly impressed by the performance of Russian MR-331 Mineral-ME naval radar and proceeded to develop its own version designated as Type 366. The major Chinese modification of the Russian system is in the data exchange and operator console, where China has improved mode of operations. Like its Russian predecessor, Type 366 radar operates in five different frequency bands and when working in the active mode, the number of targets can be handled is three times of that of when in passive mode. Type 366 radar is claimed to be superior than its Russian predecessor is when active and passive subsystems work in conjunction. In comparison to the original surface search function of its Russian predecessor, China expanded the functions on Type 366 radar by also using it as a low-altitude 2-D air search radar against sea-skimming anti-shipping missiles. With improved software, Type 366 radar is proven to be effective against sea-skimming target with radar cross section of 0.1 to 1 square meter by detecting such incoming targets at distance of 20 to 35 km range.
Uladzimir Vasilyevich Yurchanka (Belarusian: Уладзімір Васілевіч Юрчанка; Russian: Владимир Васильевич Юрченко; born 26 January 1989 in Mogilev) is a Belarusian footballer, who plays for Orsha.
Yurchenko made his debut for the U-21 national team on 9 September 2008, in a match against Latvia U21. He was part of the Belarus U21 side that participated in the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship and made appearances in all three matches. On 12 August 2009, Yurchenko netted his first goal for the Belarus U21 team, opening the scoring against the Austria U21 in the 2–1 home win in a 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifier. On 12 October 2010, Yurchenko netted twice to help his team to a 3–0 win against Italy U21, which secured qualification for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.
On 2 November 2010, Yurchenko earned his first call-up to the senior team of his country, but was subsequently injured and withdrawn from the squad for the friendly match against Oman.
On 1 June 2011, Yurchenko was selected to take part in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in Denmark, but was injured in a pre-tournament friendly and missed the competition. He was replaced by Aliaksandr Perepechka. Following his recovery from injury, he made the Belarusian squad for the 2012 Toulon Tournament and participated in all three group stage matches. He was also selected as part of the preliminary squad (including 43 players) for the 2012 London Olympics, but did not make the final cut of 22 (18 nominees + 4 reserves) footballers for the games.
Accident is Harold Pinter's 1967 British dramatic film adaptation of the 1965 novel by Nicholas Mosley. Directed by Joseph Losey, it was the second of three collaborations between Pinter and Losey, the others being The Servant (1963) and The Go-Between (1970). At the 1967 Cannes Film Festival, it won the award for Grand Prix Spécial du Jury. It also won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.
Stephen, a married Oxford tutor in his forties, has two students: the rich and likeable William, of whom he is fond, and a beautiful, enigmatic Austrian named Anna, whom he secretly covets. William also fancies Anna and hopes to know her better. Stephen, while his wife is away having their third child, looks up an old flame in London and they sleep together. Returning home, he finds that his pushy colleague Charley has broken in and is using it for sex with Anna. Her tryst discovered, she tells Stephen privately that she is getting engaged to William. Excited at his good fortune, William says he will call round to Stephen's house after a party that night. As William is too drunk to drive, Anna takes the wheel and crashes the car outside Stephen's gate. Upon finding the accident and William dead, Stephen pulls the deeply shaken Anna from the wreckage and hides her upstairs while he calls the police. When they have gone, he forces himself on her although she is still in shock and then takes her back to her rooms. He comes by in the morning to find a bemused Charley who cannot prevent Anna from packing to go back to Austria.
The screenplay showcased playwright Harold Pinter's trademark style, depicting the menace and angst bubbling just beneath the surface of commonplace remarks and seemingly innocent or banal situations. The crowning metaphor of the film comes when we see a dazed but unhurt Anna crushing her dying fiancé beneath her high-heeled shoe as she steps on his face while trying desperately to climb out of the overturned car.
The film confused many viewers who were not sure what it meant. "It's obvious what Accident meant," said Stanley Baker, who acted a lead role in the film. "It meant what was shown on the screen." Baker did concede of Joseph Losey's filmmaking that, "One of Joe's problems is that he tends to wrap things up too much for himself. I think that 75% of the audience didn't realise that Accident was a flashback." In his review upon the film's release, New York Times critic Bosley Crowther was unimpressed, calling the film "a sad little story of a wistful don" that was "neither strong drama nor stinging satire". More recently, the film has been called a "masterpiece" by Boston Globe critic Peter Keogh.
The Stone Ministry was the ministry of the fifth Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone. It was sworn in on 26 May 1995, following the Country Liberal Party caucus' election of Stone as party leader following the resignation of Marshall Perron. It was in office until 8 February 1999, when Stone resigned, and was replaced by the ministry of incoming Chief Minister Denis Burke the next day.

A duopoly (or twinstick, referring to "stick" as jargon for a radio tower) is a situation in television and radio broadcasting in which two or more stations in the same city or community share common ownership.
In the United States, the practice of duopolies has been frowned upon when using public airwaves, on the premise that it gives too much influence to one company. However, rules governing radio stations are less restrictive than those for television, allowing as many as six radio stations under common ownership in the largest U.S. media markets. Ownership of television stations with overlapping coverage areas was normally not allowed in the United States prior to 2002, even those that were not duopolies under the present legal definition, by way of being located in separate albeit adjacent markets; this required broadcasters to apply for crossownership waivers in some cases to retain full-power stations based in adjacent markets. Non-commercial educational broadcasters, mainly those that were members of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), were the only licensees allowed to sign-on or acquire a second television station that did not repeat the parent station's signal in the same market where they already owned a station (some of these acquired stations were originally licensed as commercial outlets).
On August 5, 1999, the Federal Communications Commission voted 4-1 to allow common ownership of two television stations within a single market by one company, so long as eight unique station owners remain in the market once the duopoly is formed, and the four highest-rated stations (based on local monthly viewership reports for the market) remain under separate ownership. The FCC only requires the severance of an existing duopoly in which a once lower-rated station falls within the ratings criteria that prohibits such ownership over time if an ownership transaction is under review (such as a piecemeal or group sale of stations, or necessary license transfers during an ownership transaction involving the stations' existing owner); a company is required to sell one of the stations in the duopoly to another licensee if it is no longer compliant with one or both provisions.
Once a duopoly is formed, the acquiring company takes over the operations of its new property. The operations of the two stations are usually consolidated into one facility, depending on the size and age of the facility chosen to house their operations. Since the stations involved in the duopoly are not restricted by FCC law from consolidating their operations, duplicative jobs at one of the stations are often terminated as the consolidation takes effect.
News departments are also often consolidated into a singular operation, with anchoring and reporting staffs from the respective stations often being folded into one unit, subject to hiring determinations made by management; anchors and reporters are usually shared between the two stations, though in some cases, certain anchors may be employed to appear only on each station's own newscasts. In some cases (like with WHDH and WLVI in Boston, Massachusetts, when the former's owner Sunbeam Television formed a duopoly with WLVI after purchasing the station from Tribune Broadcasting in 2006), the junior partner's news department is shut down completely, with the senior partner subsequently taking over production of its news content using only their existing staff. In many cases, news programming on a junior partner is structured to avoid direct competition with a senior partner affiliate of either ABC, NBC or CBS (one notable exception involves WTTV and WXIN in Indianapolis, which carry competing morning and evening newscasts as Tribune Broadcasting opted to launch a separate slate of newscasts for WTTV when it became a CBS affiliate in January 2015, rather than shift those seen on sister Fox affiliate WXIN to the station; WXIN and WTTV largely maintain their own anchors, but share a news department and most reporting staff). This situation is uncommon in duopolies involving only Big Three affiliates, as stations affiliated with those networks are more inclined to carry newscasts in overlapping time periods in order to fulfill local programming requirements included in affiliation agreements.
Certain syndicated programs are also shared between the stations, in the form of either same-day repeat airings of programs seen on the one which holds primary rights or separated runs of programs that air on each station, although each station maintains separate syndication inventories as well. The junior partner, unless it is affiliated with a major network, may also be used to carry network (and occasionally, first-run syndicated) programs that the senior partner is unable to broadcast because of long-form breaking news or severe weather coverage or a locally produced special airing in a scheduled program's normal timeslot, or in the case of certain non-prime time network programs, because the senior partner chooses not to carry it on its regular schedule to carry other scheduled programming.
Although the FCC bars common ownership of any of the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox), it does not prohibit duopolies involving stations affiliated individually with any two of them, unless both are among the four highest-rated in the market at the time of a sale. As such, several Big Four duopolies exist based on certain market conditions that originally allowed them to be formed under the criteria (such as a company having acquired one of the major network stations as a low-rated affiliate of a smaller network prior to an affiliation switch or the ratings of a non-English station placing among the top four over a Big Four network affiliate). While most duopolies are made up of a senior partner that is affiliated with one of the four major networks and an affiliate of a minor network (such as The CW and MyNetworkTV) or an independent station as the junior partner, those in which both stations are major network affiliates typically involve a Fox station (which serves as the junior partner in all but a few instances) and an ABC, CBS or NBC affiliate, with some limited arrangements where two Big Three affiliates are jointly owned or managed.
One of the few markets where two major network duopolies exist in some form is Jacksonville, Florida, where two companies once owned the licenses of the Big Four stations they respectively controlled. In 2000, the Gannett Company, owner of NBC affiliate WTLV, purchased ABC affiliate WJXX, which had struggled in the local ratings since its sign-on in February 1997 (when it took the ABC affiliation from WJKS through a group affiliation deal with the Allbritton Communications Company) due to its status as a relatively new station and issues with signal interference from PBS station WJCT on its Mediacom cable channel slot. The following year, Clear Channel Communications created a legal duopoly involving its existing Fox affiliate WAWS (now WFOX-TV) and WTEV-TV (now WJAX-TV), a UPN affiliate that it had been managing under a local marketing agreement since 1994; WTEV's viewership gradually rose after it became a CBS affiliate in July 2002, putting it in the top four threshold with WAWS, resulting in Newport Television – upon purchasing the Clear Channel television group in 2007 – restructuring the operation as a virtual duopoly by selling WTEV to shell licensee High Plains Broadcasting (WFOX and WJAX are now respectively owned by the Cox Media Group and Bayshore Television, LLC, but remain under common management though an LMA in which WJAX is the junior partner).
The use of digital subchannels has been termed an "instant duopoly," because of the ease by which a single digital station can deliver multiple channels of programming from different networks at the same time. One station can carry four or more standard definition digital channels; multiple high definition feeds typically require too large a bitrate size to be carried on different subchannels of the same station simultaneously without loss of image quality.
Some broadcasting companies have used loopholes to establish duopolies in smaller markets by way of a local marketing agreement, shared services agreement or joint sales agreement; where a station effectively brokers its entire airtime to the owner of another station in the market, which becomes responsible for handling its programming and advertising sales – and in effect, operations. These are termed as "virtual duopolies" as the station's license is held by one company, while its operations are handled by another. Through a 2014 FCC ruling, joint sales agreements in which the senior partner sells a minimum of 15% of the advertising time for its junior partner are counted toward ownership caps.
Some larger broadcasting companies have controversially built business models around the practice, by funding the acquisition of stations by what are effectively shill companies or shell corporations; for example, Sinclair Broadcast Group operates the stations of Cunningham Broadcasting and Deerfield Media under LMAs or SSAs. Nearly all of Cunningham's stock is held by trusts in the name of Sinclair's founders and owners, the Smith family. Similarly, Nexstar Media Group funds the purchase of stations by Mission Broadcasting, which forms duopolies with their stations through shared services agreements with a Nexstar station. In some cases, the senior partner may acquire a station's physical assets and intellectual property (such as the station's facilities and programming rights), but spin off the license itself to a shell corporation and enter into an agreement to operate the station, making it the de facto owner, but not the legal owner. Following the purchase, the station's operations and programming are often merged into that of its new parent station. Similarly, a company that acquires an existing legal duopoly that is no longer complies with FCC rules on duopoly ownership may spin off the junior partner station's license to a shell, rather than sell one of the stations to a licensee that would also assume operational responsibilities, allowing the restructured duopoly to remain under common operation through a resulting management agreement.
In some cases, the use of an adjacent-market city of license has been used on a secondary station to avoid a limit on the number of stations controlled by the same broadcaster in the same market. Occasionally, those arrangements cross international borders. For instance, radio station WLYK in Cape Vincent, New York in the United States is operated from the Canadian studios of Kingston, Ontario's CIKR-FM, a broadcaster already at the two-station limit in its own market, under an LMA. Broadcasters such as Entravision have often entered into local marketing agreements with Mexican border stations (such as Tecate's XHDTV-TDT for content directed at San Diego).
It is also possible to obtain a "failing station waiver," which can exempt a broadcaster from some portion of the existing restrictions on common ownership in order to acquire and operate a station which otherwise would be economically non-viable or would be forced to cease operations.
Requests for failing station waivers have historically met with variable reception; in general, a prospective buyer is on the same wavelength with the FCC on failing-station policies if it can demonstrate to the Commission that:
Waivers under these criteria were granted to sell WASV-TV in Asheville to Media General, owner of CBS affiliate WSPA-TV in that market, and KWBA in Tucson to the Journal Broadcast Group, owner of that market's ABC affiliate KGUN-TV. A similar waiver was refused to KNIN-TV in Boise as the station, a CW affiliate at the time the waiver application was filed, appeared to have reasonable prospects of financial break-even without a takeover by Journal-owned ABC affiliate KIVI-TV; that decision was subsequently appealed, with the waiver being granted upon further review (Journal Broadcast Group would eventually be required to sell KNIN in 2014, as the station's financial condition improved enough in its post-2011 existence as a Fox affiliate to make it unsuitable for the E. W. Scripps Company – which was in the process of purchasing Journal's broadcasting unit in a deal in which Journal simultaneously merged with Scripps' publishing unit – to acquire it under a renewed waiver, in addition to the fact that it could not acquire it legally as the market had fewer than eight unique owners).
Low-power and Class A television stations are not subject to ownership caps in the United States, as their broadcast signals do not reach as many homes as full-power stations. In areas with high cable television penetration, this distinction is essentially meaningless. LPTV stations were also exempt from digital television transition requirements imposed on full-service broadcasters upon the June 2009 digital conversion.
As such, low-power stations can also be formed to create duopolies; for instance, Weigel Broadcasting maintains triopolies in three markets surrounding the southern part of Lake Michigan (Chicago, Illinois, Milwaukee, Wisconsin and South Bend, Indiana) using a combination of full-power and low-power television stations. In Chicago, it maintains one full-power signal (independent station WCIU-TV) and two low-power stations (WWME-CD and WMEU-CA, the flagship stations of the Me-TV digital subchannel network). In Milwaukee, Weigel has two full-power stations (CBS affiliate WDJT-TV and full-power independent station WMLW-TV) and two low-power stations (Me-TV station WBME-CD and Telemundo affiliate WYTU-LD, though the latter station uses a subchannel of WMLW as its main conduit for cable carriage). Weigel also takes advantage of digital subchannel broadcasting heavily and airs This TV in Milwaukee and South Bend, and Bounce TV in Chicago and Milwaukee; the company had also previously executed time share agreements on other subchannels with ethnic broadcasters, and in Milwaukee, a local real estate agency to air programming.
A similar situation exists in Lima, Ohio, where Block Communications controls a quadropoly of stations owned by itself (WLIO, a full-powered NBC affiliate which also carries Fox and MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel) and low-power stations owned by West Central Ohio Broadcasting, Inc. (which owns ABC affiliate WLQP-LP/WOHL-CD, and CBS affiliate WLMO-LP) under an LMA. One of the latter company's heads, Allan J. Block, is the chairman of Block Communications. The group is the sole over-air provider of secular network television programming in the Lima market, though area cable systems also carry out-of-market affiliates from Toledo, Columbus and Dayton.
In radio, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) policy generally allows broadcasters to operate no more than three radio stations in any given market, of which no more than two may be on the same radio band — that is, a company may own two AM stations and an FM station, or two FM stations and an AM station, but may not own three AMs or three FMs. However, in major metropolitan markets where a large number of radio stations are already broadcasting, the limit is increased to four stations with a maximum of two on each band. A company may also exceed these limits if it owns stations broadcasting in both English and French; for instance, in the Montreal media market, Bell Media Radio owns six radio stations, of which two operate in French and four in English.
Officially, CRTC policy mandates that a broadcaster may only own one television station in a particular language in any given market. However, there are two types of exemptions which may be granted:
The policy does not prevent companies from owning multiple stations in a market provided that the stations broadcast in different languages. In recent years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a single company may own both an English-language station and one or more multicultural stations with some English-language content, which in itself may be considered a form of "exemption". CBC/Radio-Canada owned-and-operated stations (O&Os) are also often deployed in pairs in major cities on both television and radio, separated only by language. In addition, the policy is not interpreted as preventing a single company from owning both a "commercial" general-interest station and an educational station in the same market, even if the latter airs advertising, as with Access in Alberta.
Although the small and large market exemptions have a financial criterion in common, there are notable differences between the two. A small market twinstick may involve major network affiliates licensed to the same community, and is not obligated to provide distinct local news programming on the two stations, while in a large market the stations must be licensed to serve different communities or different programming niches, and cannot merge their news programming into a single operation. Small market twinsticks commonly share their branding across both stations, while twinsticks in large markets generally do not. As well, while small market twinsticks generally involve private affiliates, major market twinsticks are virtually always owned-and-operated stations of their associated networks or systems.
In a few isolated cases, the CRTC has permitted "triple-sticks", or triopolies, where a single broadcaster operates three stations in a market. These are only possible under unusual circumstances which are discussed as they arise below.
Twinsticks were first allowed in 1967, as a way to help expand CTV service to smaller markets. In the original twinstick model, the second station was a rebroadcaster of a CTV station in a larger market, to which the small market's existing CBC affiliate would be granted the advertising sales rights.
As the company's advertising revenue grew, the CTV transmitter would eventually become an originating station in its own right, and in theory would eventually be sold to another broadcaster. However, in many cases the subsequent sale never happened, as the community's economic growth failed to lend itself to competition between multiple television broadcasters. In other markets where the CRTC had licensed competing broadcasters, such as Northern Ontario, twinstick mergers were subsequently allowed to permit the survival of both television stations after similar economic difficulties were encountered.
With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership, nearly all of the original twinstick stations no longer share ownership with their former twin stations. However, the second type of twinstick, involving media consolidation in larger markets, began to arise in the 1990s.
Up until February 2010, twinsticks of this type outside of Quebec involved CTV and CBC Television affiliates. Currently, the Lloydminster stations are CTV and CBC affiliates, while the Thunder Bay stations are Global and CTV affiliates.
From 1997 to 2002, CTV directly owned several CBC twinstick stations that it had inherited from Baton Broadcasting (CKNC, CHNB, CJIC and CFCL in Northern Ontario, which were part of the MCTV system, and CKBI and CKOS in Saskatchewan); these were sold to the CBC in 2002.
One "triple-stick" also exists, in which a single company, Télé Inter-Rives, operates all three licensed stations in Rivière-du-Loup: CKRT, CIMT and CFTF. An unofficial triple-stick also exists in the Rouyn-Noranda area, as RNC Media, the licensed owner of that city's twinstick, also operates CFVS, the sole station licensed to the nearby city of Val-d'Or; in actual practice, all three stations serve both cities. These unusual situations arise because of the unique circumstances of francophone television stations in Quebec: with virtually no sources for syndicated programming, the stations are effectively constrained to network programming at all times, and both TVA and Radio-Canada maintain direct editorial control of local newscasts on all of their affiliates – meaning that despite being owned by a single company, the stations are still able to meet the guiding principles behind the CRTC's policies on media ownership.
As noted above, historically, twinstick operations were locally owned. With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership in Canada, however, most twinstick operations are now owned by major media conglomerates. The Thunder Bay Television stations (CHFD/CKPR) are the sole remaining locally owned twinstick anywhere in English Canada. The aforementioned Télé Inter-Rives is similarly unique in Quebec, although it is itself partially owned by Quebecor.
Until August 2008, Cogeco owned three twinsticks in Quebec: CKTV and CFRS in Saguenay, CKSH and CFKS in Sherbrooke and CKTM and CFKM in Trois-Rivières. These twinsticks were dissolved when Radio-Canada decided to acquire its former affiliates (CKTV, CKSH and CKTM), while the V affiliates (CFRS, CFKS and CFKM) were acquired by Remstar Corporation, the new owner of V (then known as TQS).
In the mid-1990s, the CRTC also began to allow private companies operating in large markets to acquire smaller stations. In all such cases, the twinsticks are permitted because a diversity of broadcast voices already exists in the market, and the stations are normally licensed to serve different communities in the metropolitan market or different programming niches. The stations must also be operated independently of each other, although they are permitted to cross-promote each other's programming. They may also air a very limited amount of common programming, although in practice this privilege is rarely used.
In addition to these "true" twinsticks, in some areas, Bell Media has taken a twinstick-type approach with two stations deemed to be in adjacent media markets, but which in practice serve both markets. For example, Bell operates both CTV station CKCO-DT in Kitchener, Ontario and CTV Two station CFPL-DT in London, about 100 kilometres (62 mi) away. Both have been carried on the VHF band of basic cable throughout much of southwestern Ontario for several decades. Hence, presumably as a result of this duplicated coverage, their current owner has elected to continue airing distinct programming on both stations (on the other hand, Kitchener is also about 100 km from Toronto; nevertheless both CKCO and Toronto's CFTO operate as CTV stations).
Finally, in some markets, Bell Media operates both a local over-the-air CTV station, and a provincial or regional cable channel that broadcasts CTV Two programming. In Alberta, CTV stations CFCN in Calgary and CFRN in Edmonton co-exist with CTV Two Alberta, which is officially licensed as the provincial educational broadcaster and is therefore technically exempt from the CRTC's common ownership policy (prior to September 2011, CTV Two Alberta also operated over-the-air transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton). In the Maritime Provinces, Bell Media operates both the over-the-air CTV Atlantic group of stations and the cable-only CTV Two Atlantic, which have been jointly owned (under various parent companies) since the latter's launch in 1983.
Canwest operated the CIII/CHCH twinstick in Toronto-Hamilton and the CHAN/CHEK twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria until 2009, under the Global and E! brands. These two sets of twinsticks were separated as a result of E!'s demise in August 2009, with Canwest retaining the Global O&Os (CIII and CHAN) and selling off the E! stations (CHCH and CHEK). Additionally, Canwest previously owned the now-defunct CHCA in Red Deer, which was available on cable and via rebroadcast transmitters in both Calgary and Edmonton, where Canwest respectively already owned CICT and CITV. This was not considered a true twinstick as CHCA was not based in the larger markets, and did not have permission to solicit local advertising in those markets. It did, however, have simultaneous substitution rights.
CHUM Television operated the CITY/CKVR twinstick in Toronto-Barrie and the CKVU/CIVI twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria under the Citytv and A-Channel brands prior to its acquisition by CTVglobemedia in 2006. Following this acquisition, Rogers Media briefly held twinsticks in Vancouver (CKVU and CHNU) and Winnipeg (CHMI and CIIT), formed from its newly acquired Citytv stations and its Omni-branded religious stations; these two sets of twinsticks were dissolved in 2008 following the sales of CHNU and CIIT to S-VOX.
Unlike the situation in smaller markets, this type of "consolidation" twinstick had been increasingly common up to the late 2000s, concurrently with the rise of secondary television systems (such as CH/E! and A-Channel) launched by their parent companies to complement their primary networks or systems (such as Global and Citytv). This trend was partially reversed in 2009 with the demise of E! and the subsequent dissolution of the Global/E! twinsticks.
In many major markets, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates both CBC Television (English) and Ici Radio-Canada Télé (French) stations, as listed below. Prior to the CBC decommissioning all of its television rebroadcasters in 2012, both networks were available over-the-air in numerous other markets not listed below, but one or both of the transmitters was a rebroadcaster of a station originating in a different city; these were not usually considered true twinsticks. Nevertheless, both networks continue to be available as part of the basic programming tier on all cable and satellite providers nationwide.
In Toronto, Edmonton and Calgary, Rogers Media's acquisition of the Citytv system put those stations in twinsticks with the multilingual Omni Television stations. In Toronto, Omni Television has its own twinstick, giving the company a nominal "triple-stick" in that market. The two Omni stations in Toronto each serve different segments of the market's multicultural audience, and thus are also permitted under the language exemption.
In Montreal, Canwest owned both Global station CKMI and multicultural station CJNT until August 2009, when the latter was sold to Channel Zero.
CTV was formerly a part-owner of the francophone V network (formerly TQS) in Quebec, meaning that V's owned-and-operated CFJP in Montreal was a partial twinstick with CTV's CFCF for most of the 2000s. CFCF was, in fact, the original owner of TQS, meaning that the stations were once a true twinstick under the language exemption, although the two stations went through very different sequences of ownership changes after 1995.
NBCUniversal formerly owned three full-power stations in Los Angeles, NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC, Telemundo O&O KVEA and Spanish language independent station KWHY-TV, before selling KWHY (now an affiliate of MundoFox) to the Meruelo Group in January 2011. The FCC allows common ownership of three full-power television stations if there are 18 stations that are licensed within the market; as such, Los Angeles and San Francisco are the only two U.S. markets which can legally have a true full-power triopoly.
The Federal Communications Commission otherwise only permits common ownership of three full-power television stations within one market if the tertiary station is licensed under a satellite station waiver (the FCC constitutes a full-power station that is licensed as a satellite as the same entity as its parent station, and therefore does not count them toward market ownership caps). A unique instance exists in Austin, Texas involving the de facto triopoly of NBC affiliate KXAN-TV, CW affiliate KNVA and MyNetworkTV affiliate KBVO, the latter of which signed on in 1991 as a Llano-based satellite of KXAN to serve western portions of the market where reception of that station's UHF signal was impaired by the hilly terrain within the area. Even though KBVO was converted into a separately programmed station in October 2009 (and therefore no longer acts as a KXAN repeater, even by way of a subchannel), the FCC granted Media General permission to acquire its license under an existing satellite waiver during that company's merger with LIN Media in 2014 (without the waiver, Media General/LIN would have been forced to sell either KBVO or KNVA, which would not have been viable in any event, since there are not enough unique full-power station owners in the Austin market to permit a second legal duopoly with an owner of one of the market's three English language major network affiliates and neither would have likely had long-term financial survivability as a standalone station).
In 2013, through its acquisition of stations from Newport Television, Nexstar and Mission Broadcasting formed a full-power virtual quadropoly made up of two legal duopolies in Little Rock, Arkansas consisting of NBC affiliate KARK-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate KARZ-TV (which Nexstar already owned), and Fox affiliate KLRT-TV and CW affiliate KASN (another existing duopoly that was acquired by Mission). Through the resulting local marketing agreement with Nexstar, the operations of KLRT and KASN were consolidated into KARK/KARZ's facilities; 30 employees were laid off as part of the consolidation. A similar virtual quadropoly in the Mobile, Alabama-Pensacola, Florida market was formed through another acquisition from Newport, this time by Sinclair, consisting of Pensacola-based ABC affiliate WEAR-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX (which were both already owned by Sinclair and licensed to the beach community of Fort Walton Beach), and Mobile-based NBC affiliate WPMI and Pensacola-licensed independent station WJTC (owned by Deerfield, and operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement). Unlike the quadropoly in Little Rock, Sinclair has not consolidated all four stations into one facility and each duopoly maintains their own studios in different parts of the market (WEAR/WFGX on the Florida side, WPMI/WJTC on the Alabama side). Similarly structured virtual triopolies (many of which are run by Nexstar and Sinclair) also exist in a few markets, in which either an existing owner-operator of a legal duopoly also manages a tertiary station owned by a separate if indirectly related licensee, or owns-operates one station and runs two others that are owned by different licensees.
In Canada, at least one community (Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec) has all three of its local French language stations – CKRT-DT, CIMT-DT and CFTF-DT – under common ownership, however such levels of common ownership are for the most part strongly discouraged by the CRTC unless the stations serve remote communities or separately carry programming in different languages (such as Rogers Media's aforementioned triopoly in Toronto, consisting of the English-language CITY-DT and multicultural stations CFMT-DT and CJMT-DT).
In Mexico, media concentration is endemic and it is not uncommon for as many as four stations to be operated by one entity. Televisa owns four Mexico City stations (XEW, XHTV, XHGC and XEQ) while Azteca, Mexico's second-largest broadcaster, owns three (XHIMT, XHDF and XHTVM). These stations, in turn, feed large numbers of full-power affiliates. The largest Mexican network is the Televisa-owned Canal de las Estrellas, which feeds its programming to more than 100 stations nationwide.
Gary John Poole (born 11 September 1967) is an English former professional footballer who played as a right-back. He made more than 250 appearances in the Football League, and a further 76 in the Conference.
Poole was born in Stratford, London. He came through the juniors at Tottenham Hotspur and was given a professional contract, but made no appearances for the first team and was released after two years. He signed for Fourth Division club Cambridge United, and after 18 months was sold for £3,000 to Conference side Barnet, managed by Barry Fry. In his first full season Barnet were promoted as champions to Division Four, and reached the play-offs in 1991–92.
He was then allowed to leave on a free transfer to Plymouth Argyle in the newly designated Second Division (third tier), where he captained the side. While at Plymouth he was involved in an incident which ended Rotherham United winger John Buckley's Football League career. Buckley was knocked unconscious in a clash of heads with Poole, requiring emergency surgery to remove a blood clot from the brain, and remained in a coma on life support for four days.
Poole spent just one season at Plymouth before Fry brought him to Southend United of Division One for a club record fee of £350,000. Another year later he joined up with Fry again, this time at Birmingham City, newly relegated to the third tier of English football, for a fee of £50,000. Success followed in 1994–95 with the Second Division championship and victory in the Football League Trophy at Wembley. The next season Poole took over the captaincy after Liam Daish was sold to Coventry City, captaining the side in the League Cup semi-final against Leeds United.
In the match against Manchester City at Maine Road in September 1996, referee Richard Poulain awarded a penalty late on; Poole, who had conceded the free kick which led to the penalty, lost control and pushed the referee from behind such that he needed treatment for whiplash after the game. The Football Association imposed an instant suspension on the player; after a hearing, the length of the ban was set at four matches. A month later manager Trevor Francis sold him to fellow First Division club Charlton Athletic for a fee of £250,000.
He played 16 games for Charlton that season, but a knee injury sustained in a reserve team match put an end to his first-team career. Still contracted to the club when they gained promotion to the Premier League the following season, he attempted a comeback in the reserves after more than a year out, but never appeared in the top flight and retired in August 1999.
Sand Lake is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 10,135. The town is in the south-central part of the county. Sand Lake is east of Albany, New York.
The town of Sand Lake was formed from Greenbush and Berlin June 19, 1812. In 1843 a part of Greenbush was taken off, and in 1848 the northern half was set off as a separate town under the name of Poestenkill. Sand Lake is south of the centre of Rensselaer county. It is bounded on the north by Poestenkill, on the east by Berlin, on the south by Nassau and Schodack and on the west by East Greenbush and North Greenbush.
While the surface of the town is undulating in the west, it is quite mountainous in the east, a part of the Rensselaer Plateau extending through that section of the town. Oak hill, near the centre of the town, and Perigo hill, in the northeast corner, rise to a height of about 900 feet (270 m) above the level of the sea. The soil is very fertile in many parts of Sand Lake, especially in the comparatively low land in the eastern portion. Agriculture and grazing have always been carried on with success. In recent years numerous garden farms have been established, the markets of Troy being supplied largely by these in the proper season. Sand Lake strawberries and other berries and small fruits are among the finest produced in Eastern New York. One of the principal characteristics of the town is its numerous small lakes, in which fish of nearly all kinds inhabiting still fresh water abound, and the number of summer guests in all parts of the town is constantly increasing. Crystal Lake is near the centre of the town, and is the largest body of water lying entirely within the limits of the town. Burden Lake and Crooked Lake are in the southern part, the former lying partly in the town of Nassau. Glass Lake is between Crystal Lake and Crooked Lake. Big Bowman and Little Bowman ponds are close together in the eastern part, and Richard Pond is in the northwestern part near Averill Park. The Wynants Kill and the Tsatsawassa are the principal streams. The former rises in Crooked Lake and flows through Glass Lake and Burden Lake into the Hudson River at North Greenbush. It also drains Richard Pond. The latter drains the eastern part of the town and flows southerly into Nassau. The Wynants Kill furnishes one of the finest water powers in eastern New York.
The first permanent settlements in Sand Lake were made in its western part, probably in 1765 or 1766. The earliest inhabitants located in the western part of the town. They were sturdy Dutch farmers who had come from the Netherlands a few years after the settlement of Albany, or who had first located further down the valley of the Hudson. In 1767 there were but two families, as far as is known, residing within the limits of the town. One of these was a family named Adams, residing near the river in the southern part of the town. The other was a family named Brett (or Bradt), who had a home a short distance from that of the Adams family. Which of these was the first to locate within the limits of the town cannot be learned.
A few years after these settlements were made the family of Abram Bristol lived on the west side of Burden Lake; and on the opposite side resided the family of Ephraim Quimby. About the same time or a year or two later, certainly before the War of the Revolution, a home was established in the southwestern part of the town, near the farm of Mr. Brett, by Andrew Weatherwax (Andreas Wederwax). Not far from him Philip Carpenter was located. Philip Gardner located about a mile west of the site of Sand Lake village during or immediately after the Revolution. Soon after Abram Frere settled at West Sand Lake, probably in 1790. Near him, and not much later, Jacob Fellows, Nicholas Fellows and Zachariah Fellows built homes and began the cultivation of the land on an extensive scale. The first hotel in that section was kept by Nicholas Fellows. Andreas Baert settled in the closing days of the eighteenth century in the southwestern part of the town, and among his neighbors were John Carmichael, who served in the War of the Revolution; John I. Miller and Stephen Miller.
In 1768 William Carpenter and Joshua Lockwood built a grist mill at West Sand Lake, the first in the town. Other early settlers near him were Michael Reichard, Hendrick Younghaus, who had two sons, Henry and Wynant; B. Brumagen and Job Gilbert. Thomas and Calyin Thompson made an early settlement at Sand Lake village, the former building a saw mill and forge on the creek there. Solomon Taylor, who came from Schodack about 1791, operated a saw mill in town. In the northern part of the town, among the first residents were Andrew Smith, Martinus Smith, Isaac Root, Henry Stupplebeen, John Stupplebeen, Godfrey Wood and Samuel Hammond. The Rexford family located at an early day in the southwestern corner of the town. Among their earliest neighbors were the Wilkinson family, Donald and his brother. Gilbert Westfall, John Bowman and John Miller were early inhabitants of the western section.
One of the first physicians in Sand Lake - the earliest of whom there appears to be any positive record - was Dr. Uriah M. Gregory, who located near Sand Lake village with his brothers, Stephen, Daniel M., Justus and Eben Gregory. Justus Gregory was a Methodist minister, Daniel M. Gregory was a glass manufacturer and store-keeper, and Eben Gregory was a shoemaker and tanner. A man named Stone was also a shoemaker and tanner, and located nearby about the same time. Several other early inhabitants were engaged in glass making at a very early period. The Averill family, of which James K. Averill of Averill Park is a descendant, were also among the early settlers in the western portion of Sand Lake. About 1790 William Butz, who had served in the War of the Revolution, located with his family at Sand Lake. John Upham, also a Revolutionary soldier, located near Crooked Lake and raised a large family.
Among the other pioneers of Sand Lake, some of the prominent men were: Nick Youngstein, Joshua Niemiec, Allan Youngstein, Frederick Shaver, Lawrence Wederwax, Barnhardt Uline, Michael Cipperley, Joseph H. Cipperley, John T. Snook, Thomas Johnson, William Goslin, Wynant Van Aistyne, Daniel Thompson, Solomon Taylor, Lewis Bullock, Timothy Bowerman, Lewis Finch, Nicholas Reichard, Eleazer Peck, Wright Thorn, John Souter, Henry Mould. John Crook, John Clapper, Henry Coons, John Warner, Major Thomas Frothingham, who was an officer in the Continental army during the War of the Revolution; N. Smith, Reuben Underwood, David Arnold, and families bearing the names of Fethers, Ford, Davis, Cook, Emmons, Culver, Farrell, Pratt, Lewis, Wells, Huntley, Wickham, Fuller, Strope, Hegeman, Sheppard, Higgenbottom, De Freest, Rykert, Woodworth, Hayes, Townsend, Richmond, Cornwell, Carmichael, Stone, Russell, Frear (probably Frere), Guyot, Kelly, Kerner, Jacobs, Simmons, Comb, Calkins, Kilmer and others.
Probably the first tavern in town was kept by Nicholas Fellows at or very near the present site of Averill Park (West Sand Lake), though another was established very soon after by Barnhardt Uline near the same point. In the southwestern part of the town another was kept by one of the Rexford brothers. At Sand Lake village a tavern was built at an early clay, but who its proprietor was is not known. The second was owned by Thomas Thompson. The latter for many years was one of the most popular public resorts in the town, and all stages stopped there. Later proprietors of this famous inn have been John Whittaker, Levi Parker, Franklin Averill and James H. Gabler. About 1820 a hotel was built at Sliter's Corners by Clement Sliter, after whom the hamlet was named. About the same time John Bowers had a hotel at Glass House. About 1840 John Miller built a hotel at South Sand Lake. Lewis Bullock had one on the old "Bullock place" as early as 1800, possibly before that year. Other early tavern-keepers in the town were Theodorus Gregory, Pliny Miller and Jacob Hegeman.
The first store at Sand Lake was started about 1795 by Solomon Taylor. Later on Thomas Thompson and Calvin Thompson became successful merchants, and still later Stephen Gregory. At Glass House the first merchant was Daniel M. Gregory. About 1830 Franklin Averill conducted a store at Sliter's Corners, and about the same time William Stevens established one at South Sand Lake, which in its early days was known as Stevens Corners. Soon after Nicholas Lester entered into business there. At West Sand Lake Barnhardt Uline kept a small store in connection with his tavern. Before 1830 William L. Stewart, then William H. Snyder, had stores in the same locality.
Dr. Uriah M. Gregory doubtless was the first physician to begin practice in the town. His son, Dr. Charles H. Gregory, was also a practitioner. As early as 1820 Dr. Asaph Clark was in practice. At Sliter's Corners Dr. Albert Ball and Dr. Joseph H. Elmore were early physicians. Dr. Benjamin Judson opened an office at West Sand Lake about 1825. Dr. Philander H. Thomas, Dr. Platt Burton and Dr. 0. E. Lansing were also early practitioners there. Among other physicians who were in practice during the first half of the century were Dr. Lorenzo D. Streeter, Dr. Thomas Browning, Dr. Diller, Dr. Nicholas B. Harris and Dr. Alexander H. Hull. One of the earliest lawyers in town was Cornelius Snyder.
The first turnpike in Sand Lake was established about 1795, and extended from Albany to Berlin. About thirty years afterward the Troy and Sand Lake turnpike was constructed, and a short time afterward the Eastern Union turnpike, which had its eastern terminus in Hancock, Mass., and ran through Sand Lake village, was built. The early records of the town meetings in Sand Lake, unfortunately, are incomplete. The first meeting was held soon after the organization of the town in 1812, but the date does not appear. Ebenezer Gregory was elected moderator and the first town officers chosen, as far as can be determined from the minutes of the meeting, were school directors Dr. Uriah M. Gregory, William Gorsline and Samuel Delamater. Ebenezer Gregory was elected poundmaster and fifty-eight overseers of highways were chosen. After the transaction of some further business the following additional officers were chosen:
Supervisor, Calvin Thompson; town clerk, David E. Gregory; assessors, Lawrence Van Aistyne, John Clint, Ezra Newton; commissioners of highways. John Stevens, John North, Jacob Boyce; overseers of the poor, Stephen Gregory, Lewis Bullock; collector, Jonathan Ford; constables, John Dinicbarke, Jonathan Ford, Henry Ford; school commissioners, Aretus Lyman, Joel Bristol, Ellis Foster.
Early provision was made for the schools of the town. One of the first buildings devoted to this purpose was located on the road between Sand Lake and Sliter's Corners, about midway between the two hamlets. Soon after common schools were established at several other points in the town. There were also several other well-conducted private schools. One of these was kept by Dr. Joseph H. Elmore and another by Mr. Jaynes at Sliter's Corners. The Sand Lake academy was founded in 1843 by Mr. Weston and was the first graded school of high standing in the town. The Sand Lake collegiate institute was established in 1852 by William H. Scram and was the first preparatory school in town. It was conducted with great success for many years and among those who received their education within its walls were many of the representative men of the town. In 1854 a high grade select school was established in the basement of the Second Lutheran church at West Sand Lake (now Averill Park). About 1860 another was started at Sliter's Corners by Harvey H. Boone.
One of the representative institutions of the town, the Mutual Insurance Association of Sand Lake, Poestenkill, Berlin and Stephentown, was founded May 21, 1878, the first directors being Joel B. Peck, Dr. E. W. Carmichael, Lewis W. Allendorph, John Vosburgh, John M. Miller, John Miller, William Upham and Arthur M. Peck. The first president was Joel B. Peck.
The Averill Park Land Improvement association was organized several years ago, principally through the efforts of James K. Averill, who has probably done more than any other single individual to further the interests of the town. Mr. Averill is a lawyer with an office in New York city, but he is in Averill Park weekly looking after the interests of the association and the village generally. An extended sketch of his life appears in the biographical department of this work.
The splendid water-power afforded by the fall in the bed of the Wynants kill was utilized to advantage at an early day, and numerous manufacturing industries have been established from time to time along the bank of the stream. As early as the year 1800 Stephen Van Rensselaer sold to a glass manufacturing company of Sloan's, Albany county, a tract of 5,000 acres (20 km2) land near the body of water which has since been known as Glass Lake. One of the principal promoters of the enterprise was James Kane. William Richmond and Major Thomas Frothingham were also interested in the works early in their history. In 1816 the works were destroyed by fire. Three years later Isaac B. Fox and Nathan R. Crandall organized a new company and built a new factory for the manufacture of window glass. The latter died about six years later, and in 1830 Richard J. Knowison became interested in the concern. Stadlers, Ruch & Co. succeeded to the business. They assigned in 1836, and from that year to 1853 the business was conducted by A. R. & S. H. Fox. In the latter year the buildings were again burned and the manufacture of glass was discontinued. For many years the manufacturers employed from seventy-five to one hundred hands, and the industry was the principal one in the town and one of the most important in the county.
Saw mills, grist mills and a forge were established on the banks of the Wynants kill at an early date, increasing in numbers as the demand warranted it. In 1800 a forge and saw mill were built by Thomas Thompson. Twenty-five years afterward Calvin Thompson built a mill, which was first run by Coleman & Heminway as a satinet mill. In the building hosiery was subsequently manufactured. About 1822 Ephraim Whittaker built a tannery on the banks of the creek. In 1862 James Aken built a hosiery mill on its site. For many years afterward it was operated successively by Jephtha Kidder, Kidder & McCreedy, Kidder & North, Nelson P. Aken and Nicholas P. Kane. Early in the century a cotton mill was run by Aretus Lyman. Conrad Aibridge also operated a similar establishment. Arnold & Robinson, then Isaac McConihe succeeded to the business. As early as 1819 Albertson's oil cloth dressing factory was in operation, which was abandoned many years ago. Two or three other concerns making cloth goods or knit goods were in operation in the town during the first half of the present century. Andrew J. Smart's paper mill was erected about 1847 or 1848 by Staats D. Tompkins, who sold it about 1865 to Eugene Merwin and John W. Merwin. Ten years later it became the property of Mr. Smart. John Van Heusen built a satinet mill about 1832 on the site of the old Knowlson mill. The building was burned in 1874, but rebuilt at once by Andrew B. Knowlson. Fonda & Sipperly had an early saw mill at Averill Park, and at the same point George Cipperley had a cloth dressing establishment soon after. In 1865 a hosiery mill was established on the same water privilege by John H. Akin and John Mc-Laren.
In the War of the Revolution many of the men of Sand Lake gave their services to their country. While the list of those serving has not been preserved, among those who are known to have been in the Continental army were Thomas Thompson, Major Thomas Frothingham, Ebenezer Lane, Daniel Peck, David Arnold, Henry Wetby, Joseph Huntington, John Croat and Robert Burroughs; among those serving in the War of 1812 were Peter Cipperley, Philip Snyder, Paul Wattenpaugh and Philip Lafite.
Sand Lake came promptly to the rescue of the government in the beginning of the War of the Rebellion. One hundred and three residents of the town enlisted, and of these the following died in the service:
Joseph Crape, Charles A. Smith, Francis Hendrick, Nelson Clements, Marcus Peck, Samuel Dowling, Barnard S. Uline, John Z. Robbins, William Slemmer, Scranton E. Wade, William H. Saxby, Andrew Trumble, Barney Marvin, Ervin E. Cole, Albert E. Adams, M. Knowlton, Leroy M. Hawkins and John Willy.
None of the hamlets in Sand Lake are very large. Of these Sand Lake village, as it is commonly known, is in the central part of the town, and is the centre of several small hamlets, all known under the general name of Sand Lake. From time to time several small mills and manufactories of various kinds have been located there, the principal ones being woolen mills, a cotton-warp mill and a paper mill. It is also well supplied with stores and hotels and the usual complements of small villages. The first postmaster, in 1815, was Daniel M. Gregory. The industries of the place have enjoyed quite a boom in recent years, and it is also becoming a favorite summer resort with many inhabitants of Troy, Albany and other cities. The village is located in a picturesque spot, and the lake, well stocked with fish, is an increasing attraction to the summer guests.
Averill Park, formerly West Sand Lake, is really an independent and comparatively new hamlet located within a short distance of the original West Sand Lake, which still bears its own name. The place is picturesquely located at the southeastern terminus of that part of the Troy & New England railroad which has been constructed since 1895, and is rapidly growing. It was named in honor of the Averill family, of whom Hon. James K. Averill has become a most conspicuous member. Through his efforts the Averill Park Land Improvement company was organized a few years ago, since which time the hamlet has been greatly improved. Averill Park has excellent hotels and a few small industries. The post office was established, as Averill, in 1880, with Frank Pettit as first postmaster; the name was changed to Averill Park in 1882. The post office is currently located near the terminus of the Troy & New England railway.
West Sand Lake is located a short distance from Averill Park and is a picturesque hamlet. It has several manufacturing industries, four churches and a number of stores. The post office was established in 1834 with Frost Myers as postmaster. The place was formerly called Ulinesville, in honor of Barnhardt Uline, the first settler.
Sliter's Corners is located about three quarters of a mile east of Sand Lake village, and received its name from the Sliter family, pioneer settlers. Its industries are small and not numerous.
South Sand Lake, as its name implies, is located in the southern part of the town, not far from the Schodack line. The post office was established there in 1854, with William Stevens as first postmaster.
Glass House is located at the point where the old glass factories were established, a short distance southeast of Sliter's Corners, near Glass Lake. It was originally called Rensselaer Village.
The first church in town was erected by the Lutherans in the earliest days of the town, and was built of logs. It was taken down in 1816 from what is now known as Cipperley farm on Parker Road removed to West Sand Lake, where it has since been known as the First Lutheran church of West Sand Lake. One of its earliest benefactors was Stephen Van Rensselaer. The Cipperley family still retains the original land grant from Stephen Van Rensselaer.
The First Presbyterian church of Sand Lake was organized, January 7, 1805, by members of the Congregational church in Nassau, who united with Presbyterians residing in Sand Lake to form the new society. It was originally known as the Protestant society and was organized as the Presbyterian church in December, 1808. Before the town of Sand Lake was erected it was known as the First Presbyterian church of Greenbush, changing its name upon the organization of Sand Lake. For many years the society worshipped in the old Union church, which later became the property of the Baptist society. In 1835 the congregation built a church of their own at Sliter's Corners. The first pastor of whom there is any record was the Rev. John Keyes, who served from 1808 to 1812.
The Sand Lake Baptist church was founded in 1831, the members coming from the Baptist churches of Schodack and the Second Baptist church of Nassau. The Rev. Calvin Williams, the first regular pastor, served from January, 1832, to November, 1833. The society began to worship in the Union church, which was built in the first decade of the present century, and which it has used for many years.
The Evangelical Lutheran church of West Sand Lake dates from the year 1837, most of the members coming from the first Lutheran church established in the village. Its first pastor was the Rev. John D. Lawyer, who had been pastor of the first Lutheran church. The house of worship was dedicated October 5, 1839, and was repaired in 1864.
The Methodist Episcopal church at Sand Lake has been established many years, but just when the first society was formed is not known, as the early records are indefinite on this point. Clark's chapel, erected in 1834, was originally connected as a charge with the Nassau Methodist Episcopal church, later with the Glass House church and finally with Sand Lake. Olive chapel, at Sand Lake, was built in 1874. It was first connected with the church at West Sand Lake, but became a part of the Sand Lake charge in 1878. The Rev. William W. Whitney was its first regular pastor. The church at Glass House and Clark's chapel were for some time one charge.
The church at West Sand Lake known as the Salem German church of the Evangelical Association was founded in 1845, and services began in the old Lutheran church with the Rev. J. G. Margquardt as pastor. One building served for a church and parsonage for several years, or until 1865, when a church edifice was erected. In 1858 a branch church was organized on the bill two miles (3 km) away, by the Rev. J. Greuzebach. In 1860 a house of worship was built for the use of the second church, the two societies being one pastoral charge.
The Methodist Episcopal church of West Land Lake was organized some time about 1835, but regular meetings were not held until 1843 or 1844. The construction of a meeting house near West Sand Lake was begun soon after the formation of the society, but it was left unfinished for several years. It was finally completed and removed nearer the centre of population at that point. During its early history services were in charge of local preachers, the first of whom, as near as can be learned, was Asa Hand.
St. Henry's Roman Catholic church at Sand Lake started in a mission established in 1868 by the Rev. Father Hopkins of St. Francis's church of Troy. The Rev. Father Gabriels, afterward bishop, who was connected with St. Joseph's provincial seminary at Troy, held the first regular services, remaining until 1870. Work upon the church edifice was begun in the fall of 1869, and the church was incorporated January 4, 1870. Chapels at Nassau and East Poestenkill were connected with St. Henry's church soon after its establishment.

The Avro 571 Buffalo was a prototype British carrier-based torpedo bomber biplane, designed and built by Avro in the 1920s. It was not selected for service, the Blackburn Ripon being ordered instead.
The Avro 571 Buffalo was designed by Avro as a private venture to meet the requirements of Air Ministry Specification 21/23, for a two-seat torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, intended to replace the Blackburn Dart. The prototype (G-EBNW) first flew at the Avro works at Hamble during 1926. It was evaluated against the Blackburn Ripon and the Handley Page Harrow, but was found to have poor handling and was therefore rejected.
The prototype was therefore rebuilt as the Avro 572 Buffalo II, with new, all-metal wings, fitted with controllable Handley Page slats and a more powerful engine. In this form, the Buffalo was much improved. By this time however, the Ripon had been declared the competition winner.
After it failed to be ordered into production, the Buffalo was converted into a seaplane in 1928 for the Air Ministry. As serial number N239, it was used for trials at the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe.

Impur is an album by English guitarist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith. It was composed in 1996 by Frith "for 100 musicians, large building and mobile audience" and was performed on 30 May 1996 by students and teachers from L’Ecole Nationale de Musique, Villeurbanne, France. Frith directed the performance but did perform himself.
Impur is the first of two performances commissioned by L’Ecole Nationale de Musique while Frith was resident music professor at the institution. The second was Impur II (2009).
Between 1994 and 1996, Frith was Composer-in-Residence at L’Ecole Nationale de Musique in Villeurbanne, France. At the end of the two-year residency, Frith organised a musical event at the school involving as many students as possible. He grouped them according to their music disciplines and placed them in all the rooms of a music building. Each group of musicians then played music Frith had prepared for them or, when required, improvised. Using synchronized stopwatches, all the groups, who could not hear each other, played strictly according to a 55-minute time-score that Frith had written. During the concert the public was invited to wander from room to room, or sit in the courtyard and listen to the sounds from the open windows. The whole performance was recorded on four ADAT recorders and later mixed.
Ardkinglas House is a Category A listed country house on the Ardkinglas Estate in Argyll, Scotland. The estate lies on the eastern shore of Loch Fyne, and the house is located close to the village of Cairndow. Dating back to the 14th century and originally a Campbell property, the estate now covers more than 12,000 acres (4,900 ha) of rolling hills and landscaped parkland. The centre of the estate was Ardkinglas Castle until this was replaced by a new house in the 18th century. This house was itself replaced by the present Ardkinglas House in the early 20th century, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer for Sir Andrew Noble. It remains the property of the Noble family, and is open to the public on a limited basis. The 18th-century woodland gardens are open all year round.
Ardkinglas Castle is thought to date from the 14th century. It was built in the form of a quadrangle around an inner courtyard measuring 98 feet (30 m) in each direction. There were large turrets on three of the corners, to the front there was a large gate tower with two flanking defensive turrets. By 1769 the castle was reported destroyed.
On 23 March 1679, Colin Campbell of Ardkinglas was made a baronet. His son Sir James Campbell, 2nd baronet, (died 1752) sat in the Parliament of Scotland from 1702 and, following the Union of Scotland and England, in the Westminster Parliament until 1741. He purchased the Dunderave estate around 1700, and was succeeded by his grandson, Lt.Col. Sir James Livingston-Campbell, son of his eldest daughter Helen.
During the 18th century the Campbells commissioned designs for a new house at Ardkinglas from some of the leading architects of the day, including Colen Campbell, Robert Adam and James Playfair. None of these designs were built, and the house constructed in 1795 has been described as "rather dull". This house was destroyed by fire in 1831 and, despite further designs from architects including William Burn and Alexander Binning, the family moved into the stable block which was adapted as the main house.
In 1810, when Sir Alexander Livingston-Campbell died, Ardkinglas was inherited by his cousin James Callander of Craigforth, who subsequently changed his name to Campbell and adopted the style of a baronet, although he was not entitled to do so.
In 1905 Ardkinglas was purchased by Sir Andrew Noble an expert on ballistics and gunnery who was chairman of Lord Armstrong's artillery works in Newcastle. Ardkinglas House was designed by architect Sir Robert Lorimer, and construction began in May 1906. Although Noble's deadline for completion of 1 August 1907 was not met, the house was fully completed in 21 months. The house was lit with electricity powered from a hydro-electric plant on the estate.
John Noble inherited the estate in 1972, and began farming oysters in the loch. In 1988 he opened the first Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, now a national chain. The house has been used as a filming location for television series, including The Crow Road and films including The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep. It is open to the public, although not on a regular basis. The house's original "Butlers Quarters" can be rented out.
The Woodland Gardens, dating back to the 18th century, are open year round with views of the exterior of Ardkinglas House and its backdrop onto Loch Fyne. The Arboretum was planted in the 1860s-70's by the Callander family and has some specimens of large trees. One of these trees a Grand Fir (Abies grandis) held the record for many years as "The Tallest tree in Britain", another tree a Silver Fir (Abies alba) is described as the "Mightiest Conifer in Europe" with a trunk girth of over 31 feet (9.4 m).
The Ardkinglas Railway was a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge estate railway built to serve the Ardkinglas Estate, former seat of Sir James Campbell, 2nd Baronet, of Ardkinglass, on the shores of Loch Fyne. The railway ran along the shore of the loch from a boat house at Caspian. The railway was built as a transportation system for the estate and as a garden toy for the estate's 17th Laird, George Livingston-Campbell-Callander. A single steam locomotive operated the line; rolling stock consisted of an open passenger carriage and several wagons. The railway was dismantled around 1900 and the equipment sold. The boiler from the locomotive was still in situ on the beach at Tayvallich on Loch Sween until the early 1950s.
San Carlo all'Arena is a Roman Catholic church built in a Baroque-style layout with a Neoclassic façade, and located on via Foria in the quartiere or neighborhood of the San Carlo all'Arena, in the city of Naples, Italy.
Originally a church annexed to a Cistercian Convent. The building was designed by Fra Giuseppe Nuvolo, and built initially by Silvestro Cordella. Construction was prolonged from 1631-1681. The church takes its name from the sandy ground upon it was built. In 1837, it underwent restoration by Francesco de Cesare, and an oval dome was added in the early 19th century. While the Cistercians were dispossessed of the property with the Napoleonic occupation, they regained the property in 1836 till the order was suppressed upon integration of Naples to the Italian state.
The interior has bas-reliefs by Vincenzo Annibale depicting a story from the Life of San Carlo and a Christ. A partially damaged, but much revered, crucifix (1599) by Michelangelo Naccherino, once stood in the Basilica dello Spirito Santo. Gennaro Maldarelli frescoed the cupola. Michele di Napoli painted a San Francesco di Paola. Giuseppe Mancinelli painted Carlo Borromeo providing the Viaticum to victims of the Plague.
The Indianapolis News was an evening newspaper published for 130 years, beginning December 7, 1869, and ending on October 1, 1999. The "Great Hoosier Daily," as it was known, at one time held the largest circulation in the state of Indiana. It was also the oldest Indianapolis newspaper until it closed and was housed in the Indianapolis News Building from 1910 to 1949.
The Indianapolis News was an evening paper, and its decline matched a growing circulation of the morning newspaper, the Indianapolis Star. Prior to the closing, there had been a partial merging of the newspaper staff with the Star.
From 1959 through 1974, conservative writer M. Stanton Evans was an editor of the News. He was an editorial writer from 1959 to 1960, rising to editor at age 26. When he became editor, he was the nation's youngest editor of a metropolitan daily newspaper.
The Parry Sound Shamrocks were a Canadian Junior ice hockey team from Parry Sound, Ontario, Canada. This defunct hockey team was a part of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League.
The Shamrocks were originally formed in 1994 as a member of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League, but in 1999 the team made the move to the Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League.
Parry Sound made the Northern Ontario Junior A Hockey League finals against the Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats in their final two seasons in the NOJHA in 1998 and 1999. The Shamrocks lost both final series.
Over the summer of 1999, the Parry Sound Shamrocks moved to the Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League, where the team had planned to cut travel costs. The plan worked, but the Shamrocks managed to accumulate debts over $80,000. The Shamrocks ice time fees remain unpaid till this day, and unsuccessfully tried to get the Seguin Bruins to pay for the outstanding debt five years after the Shamrocks folded, and Bruins were an expansion team into the OPJHL at the time. However, the Bruins rarely played at the Bobby Orr Community Centre.
Some of the most influential players through 1997 through 1999 were locals Ben Moore (U of Western) and Matt Monks (Wilfrid Laurier University). However both individual chose to put off state side scholarships with ambitions in the CIS.
One of the most-successful players to have played for the Shamrocks was forward Darryl Boyce, who appeared in 2 games for the Shamrocks in 2000-01, and managed to rack up 14 minutes in penalties. He would go on to play in the OHL for 4 seasons and then play at the University of New Brunswick. After playing in 21 games with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Columbus Blue Jackets, he now plays in Finland as of 2014-15 after spending time in the AHL.
As of today, information regarding the Parry Sound Shamrocks Junior A Hockey Club is very scarce throughout the internet. Information regarding the history of the team can be found at the Parry Sound Public Library.
Other players to have played for the Shamrocks. Eddy Lawrence, Ryan McCormack, Richard Penfold, Chris Renwick, Craig Brown, Rene Tache, John Simard, Ted Scriven, Mark Ideson, Darrin Cain, Jamie Biscardie, Shawn McTernin, Lyle Zulak, Steve Evanush, Chris Mahon, Jeff Thomas, Philip Campbell, Ryan Knox, Chris Stanley, Bobby Reed, Chris Lee, Dwayne Taylor, Trevor Thompson and Craig Stern.
Capt. Benjamin L. Willard is a fictional character in the 1979 film Apocalypse Now, played by Martin Sheen. According to the insigniae on his uniform, and/or the soldier who escorts him from his initial, stoically bitter monologue in a sparsely-furnished bedroom, to his pre-action briefing, Willard is from 505th Battalion, of the elite 173rd Airborne Brigade, assigned to MACV-SOG; the briefing involves mention of his intelligence/counterintelligence work for the CIA, carrying out secret operations including assassinations.
Both scenes also establish he worked COMSEC. An attempt to re-integrate into home-front society had apparently failed prior to the time at which the film is set, and he returns to the jungle-combat zones of Vietnam, where he seems to feel more at home. A special operations officer assigned to MACV-SOG, he has been serving in Vietnam for three years.

Sir Giles Alington, (June 1499 – 22 August 1586), knight, Lord of the Manor of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire, High Sheriff and MP for Cambridgeshire.
In the lead up to the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 King Richard III appointed Sir William Alington of Horseheath, Knt., his Commissioner of Array for Cambridgeshire. He made his last will on 15 August and was killed fighting alongside John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. His son and heir was Sir Giles Alington (1483–1522), a Knight of the Bath and twice High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, who had married Mary Gardiner, daughter & heiress of Sir Richard Gardiner, (d.1489) Lord Mayor of London by his spouse Audria, daughter of William Cotton, Lord of Landwade Manor, Cambridgeshire. The Alingtons who dwelt at Horseheath Hall thrived under the Tudor and Stuart monarchs, and had the privilege of handing to the King his first drink at coronations.
Sir Giles Alington jnr., was the eldest son of the eleven children of Sir Giles (1483-1522) and Mary. He was knighted by King Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace, London, on 11 November 1530. He attended the King as Master of Ordnance at the siege of Boulogne-sur-Mer, noted on the inscription of a clock which he brought from that siege, and affixed over the offices at Horseheath Hall, in which was contained the alarm bell of the garrison of Boulogne.
He was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in the 22nd year of the reign of Henry VIII (1531) and again in the 37th year (1546) of the same monarch. He was returned to Parliament as knight of the shire (MP) for Cambridgeshire in 1529, 1539, 1554 and 1558 and also for Liverpool in 1553.
The Alingtons lived at Horseheath Hall for centuries. The house was rebuilt in 1663-5 by architect Sir Roger Pratt; (Vitruvius Britannicus is wrong in assigning the house to Webb). It was a neo-classical eleven-bay house with a three-bay pediment, quoins, hipped roof, balustrade and belvedere on the roof. It was further enlarged in 1688, but for reasons now unknown pulled down in 1777. The splendid wrought-iron gates went to St John's College and Trinity College Cambridge, and the rectory at Cheveley.
Sir Giles Alington was married three times and outlived his son and heir. "The [1st] marriage, between Ursula daughter of Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead in the County of Suffolk, knight, Privy Councillor" and "Sir Gyles Alington of Horseheath in the countie of Cambridge" is recorded on the tomb on their grandson, James Alington, in Milden parish church, Suffolk. By Ursula Drury (d.1523) Sir Giles had a son and heir, Sir Robert, Knt., (1520–1552), and a daughter who married John Spencer of Althorp.
His second marriage was to Alice Middleton (d. before 1564), to whom he had a further five children, including Sir Richard Alington, later Master of the Rolls, (a magnificent monument to Sir Richard is in the Rolls Chapel, Chancery Lane, London). He married [3] by licence dated 1564, Margaret Talkorne (d.1586), who survived him. In his Will he mentions a worry:-"touching and concerninge the marriage betwene my foresaid nephew [sic; this should read grandson] Giles Alington and Margarett Ellington his Daughter which God is my witness I concluded and made with Sir John Spencer, rather for the goodwill and affection I bore unto him than for the profit....and could have had more by a thousand pounds...". Sir John Spencer was left his "best gowne of velvett furred with marteins" provided he ceased pressure for more than Sir Giles thought "kindlie and frindlie." His second wife Alice was the stepdaughter of Sir Thomas More.
There are several Alington memorials within Horseheath parish church including a tomb of Sir Giles (d.1586) who lies in splendour with one of his sons, one above the other, both in armour, heads on helmets and feet on hounds. There is in addition a brass to Sir Robert Alington, Knt., (d.22 May 1552) who predeceased his father. There is also another Giles Alington of Shakespeare's day on an impressive alabaster monument with his wife and their six children, he in slashed breeches and armour, she in a ruff and hooped skirt.
The arms of this family are: "Quarterly of six: 1, Sable, a bend engrailed argent between six billets of the second, ALINGTON; 2, Gules, on a bend argent three leopards' heads sable, BURGH; 3, Gules, three covered cups argent, ARGENTINE; 4, Azure, five marlets, two, two, and one or, a canton ermine; 5, Azure, sux marlets, three, two, and one or; 6, Sable, per fess and pale argent countercharged three griffins' heads erased of the first. Crest: - A talbot passant proper.
One of Sir Giles Alington's direct descendants, William Alington, became Baron Alington of Killard in the peerage of Ireland in 1642, and they were raised to that of England in 1682; the last Lord Alington d.s.p. in 1722. Arms: Sa. a bend engr. between eight billets ar. Crest: A talbot pass. ppr."
Another notable descendant is the Very Reverend Cyril Argentine Alington (d. 1955), Chaplain to H.M. King George V, Dean of Durham, and sometime Headmaster of Eton College. His daughter, Elizabeth Hester Alington (1909–1990), married Sir Alexander or Alec Douglas-Home (1903–1995), 14th Earl of Home, Lord Home of the Hirsel, and sometime Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

Aubrey Adams (died 1990) was a Jamaican pianist and keyboard player who was one of the top bandleaders in Jamaica in the 1950s, and led the Dewdroppers as well as playing with Clue J & His Blues Blasters.
Adams was active in the pre-ska era of Jamaican music when he led a band that had a residency at the Courtleigh Manor Hotel, that included tenor saxophonist Tommy McCook among others. He also played in Sonny Bradshaw's jazz band. He continued to perform in the ska era of the early 1960s, when he played piano for Clue J and His Blues Blasters, and also recorded with Roland Alphonso, Clancy Eccles, Pat Kelly, and the Soul Defenders. His keyboard playing was influential on other ska and jazz players, including Monty Alexander and he had a hit in Jamaica with "Marjie", recorded with his band The Dewdroppers, and released on Clement "Coxsone" Dodd's Worldisc label. Adams became a regular session musician for Dodd in the 1960s, and also played on sessions for Sonia Pottinger, and in Lynn Taitt's band the Jets.
The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.
Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species, and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline. However, at least two of the nineteen subpopulations are currently increasing, while another six are considered stable. For decades, large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar peoples, and polar bears remain important in their cultures. Historically, the polar bear has also been known as the white bear.
Constantine John Phipps was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species in 1774. He chose the scientific name Ursus maritimus, the Latin for 'maritime bear', due to the animal's native habitat. The Inuit refer to the animal as nanook (transliterated as nanuq in the Inupiat language). The Yupik also refer to the bear as nanuuk in Siberian Yupik. The bear is umka in the Chukchi language. In Russian, it is usually called бе́лый медве́дь (bélyj medvédj, the white bear), though an older word still in use is ошку́й (Oshkúj, which comes from the Komi oski, "bear"). In Quebec, the polar bear is referred to as ours blanc ("white bear") or ours polaire ("polar bear"). In the Norwegian-administered Svalbard archipelago, the polar bear is referred to as Isbjørn ("ice bear").
The polar bear was previously considered to be in its own genus, Thalarctos. However, evidence of hybrids between polar bears and brown bears, and of the recent evolutionary divergence of the two species, does not support the establishment of this separate genus, and the accepted scientific name is now therefore Ursus maritimus, as Phipps originally proposed.
The bear family, Ursidae, is thought to have split from other carnivorans about 38 million years ago. The Ursinae subfamily originated approximately 4.2 million years ago. The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. Fossils show that between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, the polar bear's molar teeth changed significantly from those of the brown bear. Polar bears are thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula).
The evidence from DNA analysis is more complex. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear, Ursus arctos, roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts. The mtDNA of extinct Irish brown bears is particularly close to polar bears. A comparison of the nuclear genome of polar bears with that of brown bears revealed a different pattern, the two forming genetically distinct clades that diverged approximately 603,000 years ago, although the latest research is based on analysis of the complete genomes (rather than just the mitochondria or partial nuclear genomes) of polar and brown bears, and establishes the divergence of polar and brown bears at 400,000 years ago.
However, the two species have mated intermittently for all that time, most likely coming into contact with each other during warming periods, when polar bears were driven onto land and brown bears migrated northward. Most brown bears have about 2 percent genetic material from polar bears, but one population, the ABC Islands bears has between 5 percent and 10 percent polar bear genes, indicating more frequent and recent mating. Polar bears can breed with brown bears to produce fertile grizzly–polar bear hybrids, rather than indicating that they have only recently diverged, the new evidence suggests more frequent mating has continued over a longer period of time, and thus the two bears remain genetically similar. However, because neither species can survive long in the other's ecological niche, and because they have different morphology, metabolism, social and feeding behaviours, and other phenotypic characteristics, the two bears are generally classified as separate species.
When the polar bear was originally documented, two subspecies were identified: Ursus maritimus maritimus by Constantine J. Phipps in 1774, and Ursus maritimus marinus by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776. This distinction has since been invalidated. One alleged fossil subspecies has been identified: Ursus maritimus tyrannus became extinct during the Pleistocene. U.m. tyrannus was significantly larger than the living subspecies. However, recent reanalysis of the fossil suggests that it was actually a type of brown bear.
The polar bear is found in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses as far south as Newfoundland. Due to the absence of human development in its remote habitat, it retains more of its original range than any other extant carnivore. While they are rare north of 88°, there is evidence that they range all the way across the Arctic, and as far south as James Bay in Canada. Their southernmost range is near the boundary between the subarctic and humid continental climate zones. They can occasionally drift widely with the sea ice, and there have been anecdotal sightings as far south as Berlevåg on the Norwegian mainland and the Kuril Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk. It is difficult to estimate a global population of polar bears as much of the range has been poorly studied; however, biologists use a working estimate of about 20–25,000 or 22–31,000 polar bears worldwide.
There are 19 generally recognized, discrete subpopulations, though polar bears are thought to exist only in low densities in the area of the Arctic Basin. The subpopulations display seasonal fidelity to particular areas, but DNA studies show that they are not reproductively isolated. The thirteen North American subpopulations range from the Beaufort Sea south to Hudson Bay and east to Baffin Bay in western Greenland and account for about 54% of the global population.
The range includes the territory of five nations: Denmark (Greenland), Norway (Svalbard), Russia, the United States (Alaska) and Canada. These five nations are the signatories of the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, which mandates cooperation on research and conservation efforts throughout the polar bear's range.
Modern methods of tracking polar bear populations have been implemented only since the mid-1980s, and are expensive to perform consistently over a large area. The most accurate counts require flying a helicopter in the Arctic climate to find polar bears, shooting a tranquilizer dart at the bear to sedate it, and then tagging the bear. In Nunavut, some Inuit have reported increases in bear sightings around human settlements in recent years, leading to a belief that populations are increasing. Scientists have responded by noting that hungry bears may be congregating around human settlements, leading to the illusion that populations are higher than they actually are. The Polar Bear Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission takes the position that "estimates of subpopulation size or sustainable harvest levels should not be made solely on the basis of traditional ecological knowledge without supporting scientific studies."
Of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations, three are declining, six are stable, one is increasing, and nine have insufficient data, as of 2014.
The polar bear is a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea. However, it is the only living marine mammal with powerful, large limbs and feet that allow them to cover miles on foot and run on land. Its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf and the Arctic inter-island archipelagos. These areas, known as the "Arctic ring of life", have high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic. The polar bear tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water, such as polynyas and leads (temporary stretches of open water in Arctic ice), to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet. Freshwater is limited in these environments because it is either locked up in snow or saline. Polar bears are able to produce water through the metabolism of fats found in seal blubber. Polar bears are therefore found primarily along the perimeter of the polar ice pack, rather than in the Polar Basin close to the North Pole where the density of seals is low.
Annual ice contains areas of water that appear and disappear throughout the year as the weather changes. Seals migrate in response to these changes, and polar bears must follow their prey. In Hudson Bay, James Bay, and some other areas, the ice melts completely each summer (an event often referred to as "ice-floe breakup"), forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next freeze-up. In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears retreat each summer to the ice further north that remains frozen year-round.
The only other bear of a similar size to the polar bear is the Kodiak bear, which is a subspecies of brown bear. Adult male polar bears weigh 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb) and measure 2.4–3 metres (7 ft 10 in–9 ft 10 in) in total length. The Guinness Book of World Records listed the average male as having a body mass of 385 to 410 kg (849 to 904 lb) and a shoulder height of 133 cm (4 ft 4 in), slightly smaller than the average male Kodiak bears. Around the Beaufort Sea, however, mature males reportedly average 450 kg (992 lb). Adult females are roughly half the size of males and normally weigh 150–250 kg (331–551 lb), measuring 1.8–2.4 metres (5 ft 11 in–7 ft 10 in) in length. Elsewhere, a slightly larger estimated average weight of 260 kg (573 lb) was claimed for adult females. When pregnant, however, females can weigh as much as 500 kg (1,102 lb). The polar bear is among the most sexually dimorphic of mammals, surpassed only by the pinnipeds such as elephant seals. The largest polar bear on record, reportedly weighing 1,002 kg (2,209 lb), was a male shot at Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska in 1960. This specimen, when mounted, stood 3.39 m (11 ft 1 in) tall on its hindlegs. The shoulder height of an adult polar bear is 122 to 160 cm (4 ft 0 in to 5 ft 3 in). While all bears are short-tailed, the polar bear's tail is relatively the shortest amongst living bears, ranging from 7 to 13 cm (2.8 to 5.1 in) in length.
Compared with its closest relative, the brown bear, the polar bear has a more elongated body build and a longer skull and nose. As predicted by Allen's rule for a northerly animal, the legs are stocky and the ears and tail are small. However, the feet are very large to distribute load when walking on snow or thin ice and to provide propulsion when swimming; they may measure 30 cm (12 in) across in an adult. The pads of the paws are covered with small, soft papillae (dermal bumps), which provide traction on the ice. The polar bear's claws are short and stocky compared to those of the brown bear, perhaps to serve the former's need to grip heavy prey and ice. The claws are deeply scooped on the underside to assist in digging in the ice of the natural habitat. Research of injury patterns in polar bear forelimbs found injuries to the right forelimb to be more frequent than those to the left, suggesting, perhaps, right-handedness. Unlike the brown bear, polar bears in captivity are rarely overweight or particularly large, possibly as a reaction to the warm conditions of most zoos.
The 42 teeth of a polar bear reflect its highly carnivorous diet. The cheek teeth are smaller and more jagged than in the brown bear, and the canines are larger and sharper. The dental formula is 3.1.4.23.1.4.3
Polar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur; they overheat at temperatures above 10 °C (50 °F), and are nearly invisible under infrared photography. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent. Two genes that are known to influence melanin production, LYST and AIM1, are both mutated in polar bears, possibly leading to the absence on this pigment in their fur. The guard hair is 5–15 cm (2–6 in) over most of the body. Polar bears gradually moult from May to August, but, unlike other Arctic mammals, they do not shed their coat for a darker shade to provide camouflage in summer conditions. The hollow guard hairs of a polar bear coat were once thought to act as fiber-optic tubes to conduct light to its black skin, where it could be absorbed; however, this hypothesis was disproved by a study in 1998.
The white coat usually yellows with age. When kept in captivity in warm, humid conditions, the fur may turn a pale shade of green due to algae growing inside the guard hairs. Males have significantly longer hairs on their forelegs, which increase in length until the bear reaches 14 years of age. The male's ornamental foreleg hair is thought to attract females, serving a similar function to the lion's mane.
The polar bear has an extremely well developed sense of smell, being able to detect seals nearly 1.6 km (1 mi) away and buried under 1 m (3 ft) of snow. Its hearing is about as acute as that of a human, and its vision is also good at long distances.
The polar bear is an excellent swimmer and often will swim for days. One bear swam continuously for 9 days in the frigid Bering Sea for 687 km (400 mi) to reach ice far from land. She then travelled another 1,800 km (1,100 mi). During the swim, the bear lost 22% of her body mass and her yearling cub died. With its body fat providing buoyancy, the bear swims in a dog paddle fashion using its large forepaws for propulsion. Polar bears can swim 10 km/h (6 mph). When walking, the polar bear tends to have a lumbering gait and maintains an average speed of around 5.6 km/h (3.5 mph). When sprinting, they can reach up to 40 km/h (25 mph).
Unlike brown bears, polar bears are not territorial. Although stereotyped as being voraciously aggressive, they are normally cautious in confrontations, and often choose to escape rather than fight. Satiated polar bears rarely attack humans unless severely provoked. However, due to their lack of prior human interaction, hungry polar bears are extremely unpredictable, fearless towards people and are known to kill and sometimes eat humans. Many attacks by brown bears are the result of surprising the animal, which is not the case with the polar bear. Polar bears are stealth hunters, and the victim is often unaware of the bear's presence until the attack is underway. Whereas brown bears often maul a person and then leave, polar bear attacks are more likely to be predatory and are almost always fatal. However, due to the very small human population around the Arctic, such attacks are rare. Michio Hoshino, a Japanese wildlife photographer, was once pursued briefly by a hungry male polar bear in northern Alaska. According to Hoshino, the bear started running but Hoshino made it to his truck. The bear was able to reach the truck and tore one of the doors off the truck before Hoshino was able to drive off.
In general, adult polar bears live solitary lives. Yet, they have often been seen playing together for hours at a time and even sleeping in an embrace, and polar bear zoologist Nikita Ovsianikov has described adult males as having "well-developed friendships." Cubs are especially playful as well. Among young males in particular, play-fighting may be a means of practicing for serious competition during mating seasons later in life. Polar bears are usually quiet but do communicate with various sounds and vocalizations. Females communicate with their young with moans and chuffs, and the distress calls of both cubs and subadults consists of bleats. Cubs may hum while nursing. When nervous, bears produce huffs, chuffs and snorts while hisses, growls and roars are signs of aggression. Chemical communication can also be important: bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.
In 1992, a photographer near Churchill took a now widely circulated set of photographs of a polar bear playing with a Canadian Eskimo Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) a tenth of its size. The pair wrestled harmlessly together each afternoon for ten days in a row for no apparent reason, although the bear may have been trying to demonstrate its friendliness in the hope of sharing the kennel's food. This kind of social interaction is uncommon; it is far more typical for polar bears to behave aggressively towards dogs.
The polar bear is the most carnivorous member of the bear family, and throughout most of its range, its diet primarily consists of ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus). The Arctic is home to millions of seals, which become prey when they surface in holes in the ice in order to breathe, or when they haul out on the ice to rest. Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water.
The polar bear's most common hunting method is called still-hunting: The bear uses its excellent sense of smell to locate a seal breathing hole, and crouches nearby in silence for a seal to appear. The bear may lay in wait for several hours. When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear kills the seal by biting its head to crush its skull. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice: Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within 90 m (100 yd), and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) of the seal and then suddenly rushes forth to attack. A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow.
A widespread legend tells that polar bears cover their black noses with their paws when hunting. This behaviour, if it happens, is rare – although the story exists in the oral history of northern peoples and in accounts by early Arctic explorers, there is no record of an eyewitness account of the behaviour in recent decades.
Mature bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, which are highly digestible, whereas younger bears consume the protein-rich red meat. Studies have also photographed polar bears scaling near-vertical cliffs, to eat birds' chicks and eggs. For subadult bears, which are independent of their mother but have not yet gained enough experience and body size to successfully hunt seals, scavenging the carcasses from other bears' kills is an important source of nutrition. Subadults may also be forced to accept a half-eaten carcass if they kill a seal but cannot defend it from larger polar bears. After feeding, polar bears wash themselves with water or snow.
Although polar bears are extraordinarily powerful, its primary prey species, the ringed seal, is much smaller than itself, and many of the seals hunted are pups rather than adults. Ringed seals are born weighing 5.4 kg (12 lb) and grown to an estimated average weight of only 60 kg (130 lb). They also in places prey heavily upon the harp seal (Pusa groenlandica) or the harbor seal. The bearded seal, on the other hand, can be nearly the same size as the bear itself, averaging 270 kg (600 lb). Adult male bearded seals, at 350 to 500 kg (770 to 1,100 lb) are too large for a female bear to overtake, and so are potential prey only for mature male bears. Large males also occasionally attempt to hunt and kill even larger prey items. It can kill an adult walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), although this is rarely attempted. At up to 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) and a typical adult mass range of 600 to 1,500 kg (1,300 to 3,300 lb), a walrus can be more than twice the bear's weight, and has up to 1-metre (3 ft)-long ivory tusks that can be used as formidable weapons. A polar bear may charge a group of walruses, with the goal of separating a young, infirm, or injured walrus from the pod. They will even attack adult walruses when their diving holes have frozen over or intercept them before they can get back to the diving hole in the ice. Yet, polar bears will very seldom attack full-grown adult walruses, with the largest male walrus probably invulnerable unless otherwise injured or incapacitated. Since an attack on a walrus tends to be an extremely protracted and exhausting venture, bears have been known to back down from the attack after making the initial injury to the walrus. Polar bears have also been seen to prey on beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros), by swiping at them at breathing holes. The whales are of similar size to the walrus and nearly as difficult for the bear to subdue. Most terrestrial animals in the Arctic can outrun the polar bear on land as polar bears overheat quickly, and most marine animals the bear encounters can outswim it. In some areas, the polar bear's diet is supplemented by walrus calves and by the carcasses of dead adult walruses or whales, whose blubber is readily devoured even when rotten. Polar bears sometimes swim underwater to catch fish like the Arctic charr or the fourhorn sculpin.
With the exception of pregnant females, polar bears are active year-round, although they have a vestigial hibernation induction trigger in their blood. Unlike brown and black bears, polar bears are capable of fasting for up to several months during late summer and early fall, when they cannot hunt for seals because the sea is unfrozen. When sea ice is unavailable during summer and early autumn, some populations live off fat reserves for months at a time, as polar bears do not 'hibernate' any time of the year.
Being both curious animals and scavengers, polar bears investigate and consume garbage where they come into contact with humans. Polar bears may attempt to consume almost anything they can find, including hazardous substances such as styrofoam, plastic, car batteries, ethylene glycol, hydraulic fluid, and motor oil. The dump in Churchill, Manitoba was closed in 2006 to protect bears, and waste is now recycled or transported to Thompson, Manitoba.
Although seal predation is the primary and an indispensable way of life for most polar bears, when alternatives are present they are quite flexible. Polar bears consume a wide variety of other wild foods, including muskox (Ovibos moschatus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), birds, eggs, rodents, crabs, other crustaceans and other polar bears. They may also eat plants, including berries, roots, and kelp; however, none of these have been a significant part of their diet, except for beachcast marine mammal carcasses. Given the change in climate, with ice breaking up in areas such as the Hudson Bay earlier than it used to, polar bears are exploiting food resources such as snow geese and eggs, and plants such as lyme grass in increased quantities. When stalking land animals, such as muskox, reindeer, and even willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), polar bears appear to make use of vegetative cover and wind direction to bring them as close to their prey as possible before attacking. Polar bears have been observed to hunt the small Svalbard reindeer (R. t. platyrhynchus), which weigh only 40 to 60 kg (90 to 130 lb) as adults, as well as the barren-ground caribou (R. t. groenlandicus), which is about twice as heavy as that. Adult muskox, which can weigh 450 kg (1,000 lb) or more, are a more formidable quarry. Although ungulates are not typical prey, the killing of one during the summer months can greatly increase the odds of survival during that lean period. Like the brown bear, most ungulate prey of polar bears is likely to be young, sickly or injured specimens rather than healthy adults. The polar bear's metabolism is specialized to require large amounts of fat from marine mammals, and it cannot derive sufficient caloric intake from terrestrial food.
In their southern range, especially near Hudson Bay and James Bay, Canadian polar bears endure all summer without sea ice to hunt from. Here, their food ecology shows their dietary flexibility. They still manage to consume some seals, but they are food-deprived in summer as only marine mammal carcasses are an important alternative without sea ice, especially carcasses of the beluga whale. These alternatives may reduce the rate of weight loss of bears when on land. One scientist found that 71% of the Hudson Bay bears had fed on seaweed (marine algae) and that about half were feeding on birds such as the dovekie and sea ducks, especially the long-tailed duck (53%) and common eider, by swimming underwater to catch them. They were also diving to feed on blue mussels and other underwater food sources like the green sea urchin. 24% had eaten moss recently, 19% had consumed grass, 34% had eaten black crowberry and about half had consumed willows. This study illustrates the polar bear's dietary flexibility but it does not represent its life history elsewhere. Most polar bears elsewhere will never have access to these alternatives, except for the marine mammal carcasses that are important wherever they occur.
In Svalbard, polar bears were observed to kill white-beaked dolphins during spring, when the dolphins were trapped in the sea ice. The bears then proceeded to cache the carcasses, which remained and were eaten during the ice-free summer and autumn.
Courtship and mating take place on the sea ice in April and May, when polar bears congregate in the best seal hunting areas. A male may follow the tracks of a breeding female for 100 km (60 mi) or more, and after finding her engage in intense fighting with other males over mating rights, fights that often result in scars and broken teeth. Polar bears have a generally polygynous mating system; recent genetic testing of mothers and cubs, however, has uncovered cases of litters in which cubs have different fathers. Partners stay together and mate repeatedly for an entire week; the mating ritual induces ovulation in the female.
After mating, the fertilized egg remains in a suspended state until August or September. During these four months, the pregnant female eats prodigious amounts of food, gaining at least 200 kg (440 lb) and often more than doubling her body weight.
When the ice floes break up in the fall, ending the possibility of hunting, each pregnant female digs a maternity den consisting of a narrow entrance tunnel leading to one to three chambers. Most maternity dens are in snowdrifts, but may also be made underground in permafrost if it is not sufficiently cold yet for snow. In most subpopulations, maternity dens are situated on land a few kilometers from the coast, and the individuals in a subpopulation tend to reuse the same denning areas each year. The polar bears that do not den on land make their dens on the sea ice. In the den, she enters a dormant state similar to hibernation. This hibernation-like state does not consist of continuous sleeping; however, the bear's heart rate slows from 46 to 27 beats per minute. Her body temperature does not decrease during this period as it would for a typical mammal in hibernation.
Between November and February, cubs are born blind, covered with a light down fur, and weighing less than 0.9 kg (2.0 lb), but in captivity they might be delivered in the earlier months. The earliest recorded birth of polar bears in captivity was on 11 October 2011 in the Toronto Zoo. On average, each litter has two cubs. The family remains in the den until mid-February to mid-April, with the mother maintaining her fast while nursing her cubs on a fat-rich milk. By the time the mother breaks open the entrance to the den, her cubs weigh about 10 to 15 kilograms (22 to 33 lb). For about 12 to 15 days, the family spends time outside the den while remaining in its vicinity, the mother grazing on vegetation while the cubs become used to walking and playing. Then they begin the long walk from the denning area to the sea ice, where the mother can once again catch seals. Depending on the timing of ice-floe breakup in the fall, she may have fasted for up to eight months. During this time, cubs playfully imitate the mother's hunting methods in preparation for later life.
Female polar bears are noted for both their affection towards their offspring, and their valor in protecting them. Multiple cases of adoption of wild cubs have been confirmed by genetic testing. Adult male bears occasionally kill and eat polar bear cubs. As of 2006, in Alaska, 42% of cubs were reaching 12 months of age, down from 65% in 1991. In most areas, cubs are weaned at two and a half years of age, when the mother chases them away or abandons them. The Western Hudson Bay subpopulation is unusual in that its female polar bears sometimes wean their cubs at only one and a half years. This was the case for 40% of cubs there in the early 1980s; however by the 1990s, fewer than 20% of cubs were weaned this young. After the mother leaves, sibling cubs sometimes travel and share food together for weeks or months.
Females begin to breed at the age of four years in most areas, and five years in the Beaufort Sea area. Males usually reach sexual maturity at six years; however, as competition for females is fierce, many do not breed until the age of eight or ten. A study in Hudson Bay indicated that both the reproductive success and the maternal weight of females peaked in their mid-teens.
Polar bears appear to be less affected by infectious diseases and parasites than most terrestrial mammals. Polar bears are especially susceptible to Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm they contract through cannibalism, although infections are usually not fatal. Only one case of a polar bear with rabies has been documented, even though polar bears frequently interact with Arctic foxes, which often carry rabies. Bacterial leptospirosis and Morbillivirus have been recorded. Polar bears sometimes have problems with various skin diseases that may be caused by mites or other parasites.
Polar bears rarely live beyond 25 years. The oldest wild bears on record died at age 32, whereas the oldest captive was a female who died in 1991, age 43. The causes of death in wild adult polar bears are poorly understood, as carcasses are rarely found in the species's frigid habitat. In the wild, old polar bears eventually become too weak to catch food, and gradually starve to death. Polar bears injured in fights or accidents may either die from their injuries or become unable to hunt effectively, leading to starvation.
The polar bear is the apex predator within its range, and is a keystone species for the Arctic. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills.
The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, where there is no major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The baby fur of most Arctic seal species is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic seals all have dark fur at birth.
Brown bears tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses, and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens. Wolves are rarely encountered by polar bears, though there are two records of Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos) packs killing polar bear cubs. Adult polar bears are occasionally vulnerable to predation by orcas (Orcinus orca) while swimming, but they are rarely reported as taken and bears are likely to avoid entering the water if possible if they detect an orca pod in the area. The melting sea ice in the Arctic may be causing an increase of orcas in the Arctic sea, which may increase the risk of predation on polar bears but also may benefit the bears by providing more whale carcasses that they can scavenge. The remains of polar bears have found in the stomachs of large Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus), although it certainly cannot be ruled out that the bears were merely scavenged by this slow-moving, unusual shark. A rather unlikely killer of a grown polar bear has reportedly included a wolverine (Gulo gulo), anecedotely reported to have suffocated a bear in a zoo with a bite to the throat during a conflict. This report may well be dubious, however. Polar bears are sometimes the host of arctic mites such as Alaskozetes antarcticus.
Researchers tracked 52 sows in the southern Beaufort Sea off Alaska with GPS system collars; no boars were involved in the study due to males' necks being too thick for the GPS-equipped collars. Fifty long-distance swims were recorded; the longest at 354 kilometres (220 mi), with an average of 155 kilometres (96 mi). The length of these swims ranged from most of a day to ten days. Ten of the sows had a cub swim with them and after a year, six cubs survived. The study did not determine if the others lost their cubs before, during, or some time after their long swims. Researchers do not know whether or not this is a new behaviour; before polar ice shrinkage, they opined that there was probably neither the need nor opportunity to swim such long distances.
Polar bears have long provided important raw materials for Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, Yupik, Chukchi, Nenets, Russian Pomors and others. Hunters commonly used teams of dogs to distract the bear, allowing the hunter to spear the bear or shoot it with arrows at closer range. Almost all parts of captured animals had a use. The fur was used in particular to make trousers and, by the Nenets, to make galoshes-like outer footwear called tobok; the meat is edible, despite some risk of trichinosis; the fat was used in food and as a fuel for lighting homes, alongside seal and whale blubber; sinews were used as thread for sewing clothes; the gallbladder and sometimes heart were dried and powdered for medicinal purposes; the large canine teeth were highly valued as talismans. Only the liver was not used, as its high concentration of vitamin A is poisonous. Hunters make sure to either toss the liver into the sea or bury it in order to spare their dogs from potential poisoning. Traditional subsistence hunting was on a small enough scale to not significantly affect polar bear populations, mostly because of the sparseness of the human population in polar bear habitat.
In Russia, polar bear furs were already being commercially traded in the 14th century, though it was of low value compared to Arctic fox or even reindeer fur. The growth of the human population in the Eurasian Arctic in the 16th and 17th century, together with the advent of firearms and increasing trade, dramatically increased the harvest of polar bears. However, since polar bear fur has always played a marginal commercial role, data on the historical harvest is fragmentary. It is known, for example, that already in the winter of 1784/1785 Russian Pomors on Spitsbergen harvested 150 polar bears in Magdalenefjorden. In the early 20th century, Norwegian hunters were harvesting 300 bears per year at the same location. Estimates of total historical harvest suggest that from the beginning of the 18th century, roughly 400 to 500 animals were being harvested annually in northern Eurasia, reaching a peak of 1,300 to 1,500 animals in the early 20th century, and falling off as the numbers began dwindling.
In the first half of the 20th century, mechanized and overpoweringly efficient methods of hunting and trapping came into use in North America as well. Polar bears were chased from snowmobiles, icebreakers, and airplanes, the latter practice described in a 1965 New York Times editorial as being "about as sporting as machine gunning a cow." Norwegians used "self-killing guns", comprising a loaded rifle in a baited box that was placed at the level of a bear's head, and which fired when the string attached to the bait was pulled. The numbers taken grew rapidly in the 1960s, peaking around 1968 with a global total of 1,250 bears that year.
Concerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. In 1973, the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research. The treaty allows hunting "by local people using traditional methods". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the Cold War. Biologist Ian Stirling commented, "For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear."
Agreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, Russia and the United States signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and Chukotka. The treaty was ratified in October 2007. In September 2015, the polar bear range states agreed upon a "circumpolar action plan" describing their conservation strategy for polar bears.
Although the United States government has proposed that polar bears be transferred to Appendix I of CITES, which would ban all international trade in polar bear parts, polar bears currently remain listed under Appendix II. This decision was approved of by members of the IUCN and TRAFFIC, who determined that such an uplisting was unlikely to confer a conservation benefit.
Polar bears were designated "Not at Risk" in April 1986 and uplisted to "Special Concern" in April 1991. This status was re-evaluated and confirmed in April 1999, November 2002, and April 2008. Polar bears continue to be listed as a species of special concern in Canada because of their sensitivity to overharvest and because of an expected range contraction caused by loss of Arctic sea ice.
More than 600 bears are killed per year by humans across Canada, a rate calculated by scientists to be unsustainable for some areas, notably Baffin Bay. Canada has allowed sport hunters accompanied by local guides and dog-sled teams since 1970, but the practice was not common until the 1980s. The guiding of sport hunters provides meaningful employment and an important source of income for northern communities in which economic opportunities are few. Sport hunting can bring CDN$20,000 to $35,000 per bear into northern communities, which until recently has been mostly from American hunters.
The territory of Nunavut accounts for the location 80% of annual kills in Canada. In 2005, the government of Nunavut increased the quota from 400 to 518 bears, despite protests from the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group. In two areas where harvest levels have been increased based on increased sightings, science-based studies have indicated declining populations, and a third area is considered data-deficient. While most of that quota is hunted by the indigenous Inuit people, a growing share is sold to recreational hunters. (0.8% in the 1970s, 7.1% in the 1980s, and 14.6% in the 1990s) Nunavut polar bear biologist, Mitchell Taylor, who was formerly responsible for polar bear conservation in the territory, has insisted that bear numbers are being sustained under current hunting limits. In 2010, the 2005 increase was partially reversed. Government of Nunavut officials announced that the polar bear quota for the Baffin Bay region would be gradually reduced from 105 per year to 65 by the year 2013. The Government of the Northwest Territories maintain their own quota of 72 to 103 bears within the Inuvialuit communities of which some are set aside for sports hunters. Environment Canada also banned the export from Canada of fur, claws, skulls and other products from polar bears harvested in Baffin Bay as of 1 January 2010.
Because of the way polar bear hunting quotas are managed in Canada, attempts to discourage sport hunting would actually increase the number of bears killed in the short term. Canada allocates a certain number of permits each year to sport and subsistence hunting, and those that are not used for sport hunting are re-allocated to indigenous subsistence hunting. Whereas northern communities kill all the polar bears they are permitted to take each year, only half of sport hunters with permits actually manage to kill a polar bear. If a sport hunter does not kill a polar bear before his or her permit expires, the permit cannot be transferred to another hunter.
In Greenland, hunting restrictions were first introduced in 1994 and expanded by executive order in 2005. Until 2005 Greenland placed no limit on hunting by indigenous people. However, in 2006 it imposed a limit of 150, while also allowed recreational hunting for the first time. Other provisions included year-round protection of cubs and mothers, restrictions on weapons used, and various administrative requirements to catalogue kills.
Polar bear were hunted heavily in Svalbard, Norway throughout the 19th century and to as recently as 1973, when the conservation treaty was signed. 900 bears a year were harvested in the 1920s and after World War II, there were as many as 400–500 harvested annually. Some regulations of hunting did exist. In 1927, poisoning was outlawed while in 1939, certain denning sights were declared off limits. The killing of females and cubs was made illegal in 1965. Killing of polar bears decreased somewhat 25–30 years before the treaty. Despite this, the polar bear population continued to decline and by 1973, only around 1000 bears were left in Svalbard. Only with the passage of the treaty did they begin to recover.
The Soviet Union banned the harvest of polar bears in 1956; however, poaching continued and is estimated to pose a serious threat to the polar bear population. In recent years, polar bears have approached coastal villages in Chukotka more frequently due to the shrinking of the sea ice, endangering humans and raising concerns that illegal hunting would become even more prevalent. In 2007, the Russian government made subsistence hunting legal for indigenous Chukotkan peoples only, a move supported by Russia's most prominent bear researchers and the World Wide Fund for Nature as a means to curb poaching.
Polar bears are currently listed as "Rare", of "Uncertain Status", or "Rehabilitated and rehabilitating" in the Red Data Book of Russia, depending on population. In 2010, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment published a strategy for polar bear conservation in Russia.
The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 afforded polar bears some protection in the United States. It banned hunting (except by indigenous subsistence hunters), banned importing of polar bear parts (except polar bear pelts taken legally in Canada), and banned the harassment of polar bears. On 15 May 2008, the United States Department of the Interior listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, citing the melting of Arctic sea ice as the primary threat to the polar bear. It banned all importing of polar bear trophies. Importing products made from polar bears had been prohibited from 1972 to 1994 under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and restricted between 1994 and 2008. Under those restrictions, permits from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service were required to import sport-hunted polar bear trophies taken in hunting expeditions in Canada. The permit process required that the bear be taken from an area with quotas based on sound management principles. Since 1994, hundreds of sport-hunted polar bear trophies have been imported into the U.S. In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a draft conservation management plan for polar bears to improve their status under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
Polar bear population sizes and trends are difficult to estimate accurately because they occupy remote home ranges and exist at low population densities. Polar bear fieldwork can also be hazardous to researchers. As of 2015, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports that the global population of polar bears is 22,000 to 31,000, and the current population trend is unknown. Nevertheless, polar bears are listed as "Vulnerable" under criterion A3c, which indicates an expected population decrease of ≥30% over the next three generations (~34.5 years) due to "decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat". Risks to the polar bear include climate change, pollution in the form of toxic contaminants, conflicts with shipping, oil and gas exploration and development, and human-bear interactions including harvesting and possible stresses from recreational polar-bear watching.
According to the World Wildlife Fund, the polar bear is important as an indicator of Arctic ecosystem health. Polar bears are studied to gain understanding of what is happening throughout the Arctic, because at-risk polar bears are often a sign of something wrong with the Arctic marine ecosystem.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature, Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, United States Geological Survey and many leading polar bear biologists have expressed grave concerns about the impact of climate change, including the belief that the current warming trend imperils the survival of the polar bear.
The key danger posed by climate change is malnutrition or starvation due to habitat loss. Polar bears hunt seals from a platform of sea ice. Rising temperatures cause the sea ice to melt earlier in the year, driving the bears to shore before they have built sufficient fat reserves to survive the period of scarce food in the late summer and early fall. Reduction in sea-ice cover also forces bears to swim longer distances, which further depletes their energy stores and occasionally leads to drowning. Thinner sea ice tends to deform more easily, which appears to make it more difficult for polar bears to access seals. Insufficient nourishment leads to lower reproductive rates in adult females and lower survival rates in cubs and juvenile bears, in addition to poorer body condition in bears of all ages.
In addition to creating nutritional stress, a warming climate is expected to affect various other aspects of polar bear life: Changes in sea ice affect the ability of pregnant females to build suitable maternity dens. As the distance increases between the pack ice and the coast, females must swim longer distances to reach favored denning areas on land. Thawing of permafrost would affect the bears who traditionally den underground, and warm winters could result in den roofs collapsing or having reduced insulative value. For the polar bears that currently den on multi-year ice, increased ice mobility may result in longer distances for mothers and young cubs to walk when they return to seal-hunting areas in the spring. Disease-causing bacteria and parasites would flourish more readily in a warmer climate.
Problematic interactions between polar bears and humans, such as foraging by bears in garbage dumps, have historically been more prevalent in years when ice-floe breakup occurred early and local polar bears were relatively thin. Increased human-bear interactions, including fatal attacks on humans, are likely to increase as the sea ice shrinks and hungry bears try to find food on land.
The effects of climate change are most profound in the southern part of the polar bear's range, and this is indeed where significant degradation of local populations has been observed. The Western Hudson Bay subpopulation, in a southern part of the range, also happens to be one of the best-studied polar bear subpopulations. This subpopulation feeds heavily on ringed seals in late spring, when newly weaned and easily hunted seal pups are abundant. The late spring hunting season ends for polar bears when the ice begins to melt and break up, and they fast or eat little during the summer until the sea freezes again.
Due to warming air temperatures, ice-floe breakup in western Hudson Bay is currently occurring three weeks earlier than it did 30 years ago, reducing the duration of the polar bear feeding season. The body condition of polar bears has declined during this period; the average weight of lone (and likely pregnant) female polar bears was approximately 290 kg (640 lb) in 1980 and 230 kg (510 lb) in 2004. Between 1987 and 2004, the Western Hudson Bay population declined by 22%, although the population is currently listed as "stable". As the climate change melts sea ice, the U.S. Geological Survey projects that two-thirds of polar bears will disappear by 2050.
In Alaska, the effects of sea ice shrinkage have contributed to higher mortality rates in polar bear cubs, and have led to changes in the denning locations of pregnant females. In recent years, polar bears in the Arctic have undertaken longer than usual swims to find prey, possibly resulting in four recorded drownings in the unusually large ice pack regression of 2005.
A new development is that polar bears have begun ranging to new territory. While not unheard of but still uncommon, polar bears have been sighted increasingly in larger numbers ashore, staying on the mainland for longer periods of time during the summer months, particularly in North Canada, traveling farther inland. This may cause an increased reliance on terrestrial diets, such as goose eggs, waterfowl and caribou, as well as increased human–bear conflict.
Polar bears accumulate high levels of persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides. Due to their position at the top of the ecological pyramid, with a diet heavy in blubber in which halocarbons concentrate, their bodies are among the most contaminated of Arctic mammals. Halocarbons are known to be toxic to other animals, because they mimic hormone chemistry, and biomarkers such as immunoglobulin G and retinol suggest similar effects on polar bears. PCBs have received the most study, and they have been associated with birth defects and immune system deficiency.
Many chemicals, such as PCBs and DDT, have been internationally banned due to the recognition of their harm on the environment. Their concentrations in polar bear tissues continued to rise for decades after being banned as these chemicals spread through the food chain. Since then, the trend seems to have discontinued, with tissue concentrations of PCBs declining between studies performed from 1989 to 1993 and studies performed from 1996 to 2002. During the same time periods, DDT was notably lower in the Western Hudson Bay population only.
Oil and gas development in polar bear habitat can affect the bears in a variety of ways. An oil spill in the Arctic would most likely concentrate in the areas where polar bears and their prey are also concentrated, such as sea ice leads. Because polar bears rely partly on their fur for insulation and soiling of the fur by oil reduces its insulative value, oil spills put bears at risk of dying from hypothermia. Polar bears exposed to oil spill conditions have been observed to lick the oil from their fur, leading to fatal kidney failure. Maternity dens, used by pregnant females and by females with infants, can also be disturbed by nearby oil exploration and development. Disturbance of these sensitive sites may trigger the mother to abandon her den prematurely, or abandon her litter altogether.
Steven Amstrup and other U.S. Geological Survey scientists have predicted two-thirds of the world's polar bears may disappear by 2050, based on moderate projections for the shrinking of summer sea ice caused by climate change, though the validity of this study has been debated. The bears could disappear from Europe, Asia, and Alaska, and be depleted from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and areas off the northern Greenland coast. By 2080, they could disappear from Greenland entirely and from the northern Canadian coast, leaving only dwindling numbers in the interior Arctic Archipelago. However, in the short term, some polar bear populations in historically colder regions of the Arctic may temporarily benefit from a milder climate, as multiyear ice that is too thick for seals to create breathing holes is replaced by thinner annual ice.
Polar bears diverged from brown bears 400,000–600,000 years ago and have survived past periods of climate fluctuation. It has been claimed that polar bears will be able to adapt to terrestrial food sources as the sea ice they use to hunt seals disappears. However, most polar bear biologists think that polar bears will be unable to completely offset the loss of calorie-rich seal blubber with terrestrial foods, and that they will be outcompeted by brown bears in this terrestrial niche, ultimately leading to a population decline.
Warnings about the future of the polar bear are often contrasted with the fact that worldwide population estimates have increased over the past 50 years and are relatively stable today. Some estimates of the global population are around 5,000 to 10,000 in the early 1970s; other estimates were 20,000 to 40,000 during the 1980s. Current estimates put the global population at between 20,000 and 25,000 or 22,000 and 31,000.
There are several reasons for the apparent discordance between past and projected population trends: estimates from the 1950s and 1960s were based on stories from explorers and hunters rather than on scientific surveys. Second, controls of harvesting were introduced that allowed this previously overhunted species to recover. Third, the recent effects of climate change have affected sea ice abundance in different areas to varying degrees.
Debate over the listing of the polar bear under endangered species legislation has put conservation groups and Canada's Inuit at opposing positions; the Nunavut government and many northern residents have condemned the U.S. initiative to list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act. Many Inuit believe the polar bear population is increasing, and restrictions on commercial sport-hunting are likely to lead to a loss of income to their communities.
For the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, polar bears have long played an important cultural and material role. Polar bear remains have been found at hunting sites dating to 2,500 to 3,000 years ago and 1,500-year-old cave paintings of polar bears have been found in the Chukchi Peninsula. Indeed, it has been suggested that Arctic peoples' skills in seal hunting and igloo construction has been in part acquired from the polar bears themselves.
The Inuit and Alaska Natives have many folk tales featuring the bears including legends in which bears are humans when inside their own houses and put on bear hides when going outside, and stories of how the constellation that is said to resemble a great bear surrounded by dogs came into being. These legends reveal a deep respect for the polar bear, which is portrayed as both spiritually powerful and closely akin to humans. The human-like posture of bears when standing and sitting, and the resemblance of a skinned bear carcass to the human body, have probably contributed to the belief that the spirits of humans and bears were interchangeable.
Among the Chukchi and Yupik of eastern Siberia, there was a longstanding shamanistic ritual of "thanksgiving" to the hunted polar bear. After killing the animal, its head and skin were removed and cleaned and brought into the home, and a feast was held in the hunting camp in its honor. To appease the spirit of the bear, traditional song and drum music was played, and the skull was ceremonially fed and offered a pipe. Only once the spirit was appeased was the skull be separated from the skin, taken beyond the bounds of the homestead, and placed in the ground, facing north.
The Nenets of north-central Siberia placed particular value on the talismanic power of the prominent canine teeth. These were traded in the villages of the lower Yenisei and Khatanga rivers to the forest-dwelling peoples further south, who would sew them into their hats as protection against brown bears. It was believed that the "little nephew" (the brown bear) would not dare to attack a man wearing the tooth of its powerful "big uncle", the polar bear. The skulls of killed polar bears were buried at sacred sites, and altars, called sedyangi, were constructed out of the skulls. Several such sites have been preserved on the Yamal Peninsula.
Their distinctive appearance and their association with the Arctic have made polar bears popular icons, especially in those areas where they are native. The Canadian two-dollar coin carries an image of a lone polar bear on its reverse side, while a special millennium edition featured three. Vehicle license plates in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut in Canada are in the shape of a polar bear. The polar bear is the mascot of Bowdoin College, Maine, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the 1988 Winter Olympics held in Calgary. The Eisbären Berlin hockey team uses a roaring polar bear as their logo.
Companies such as Coca-Cola, Polar Beverages, Nelvana, Bundaberg Rum, and Good Humor-Breyers have used images of the polar bear in advertising, while Fox's Glacier Mints have featured a polar bear named Peppy as the brand mascot since 1922.
Polar bears are popular in fiction, particularly in books for children or teenagers. For example, The Polar Bear Son is adapted from a traditional Inuit tale. The animated television series Noah's Island features a polar bear named Noah as the protagonist. Polar bears feature prominently in East (also released as North Child) by Edith Pattou, The Bear by Raymond Briggs (adapted into an animated short in 1998), and Chris d'Lacey's The Fire Within series. The panserbjørne of Philip Pullman's fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials are sapient, dignified polar bears who exhibit anthropomorphic qualities, and feature prominently in the 2007 film adaptation of The Golden Compass. The television series Lost features polar bears living on the tropical island setting.
Frans Hendrik Karel Zaalberg (26 November 1873 – 13 February 1928) was an Indo (Eurasian) journalist and politician in the Dutch East Indies.
He was born in Batavia, Java, Dutch East Indies, and also died there. He was the son of a Dutch father Pieter Jacobus Adrianus Zaalberg, Secretary at the Department of Education and Religious Affairs in the Dutch East Indies, and Indo (Eurasian) mother Susanna Elisabeth de Bie. He was married to Maria Taunay (born 1878) from 22 April 1899 up to her death in 1911. Both the Zaalberg and De Bie family were of Jewish descent. They had two sons and three daughters, one of whom died young.
Karel Zaalberg was a self-taught and self-made man. With only primary school he became chief editor of one of the biggest newspapers. Education for the Indo-Europeans of the Dutch East Indies would be his life's personal and political ambition. As a journalist he became a spokesman for the Indo-European (Eurasian) community.
He was director of the first organization for Indo-Europeans in the Dutch East Indies ('Indische Bond' of 1898). After 1919 he became a founder and board member of the Indo-European Alliance (Dutch: ‘Indo Europeesch Verbond'), with over 10,000 members the largest interest group of this population. From 1924 until his death, four years later, he represented the party in the Dutch East Indies People's Council (Volksraad).
Zaalberg was a leading figure in the political and social emancipation of the Indo (Eurasian) community of the Dutch East Indies of the late 19th and early 20th century, who had closely befriended famous figures of the time like writer P.A. Daum, E.du Perron and independence activist Ernest Douwes Dekker.
Due to a traffic accident his father became disabled and the impoverished family was unable to send their children to any form of higher or even secondary education. Young Zaalberg found a simple and low-ranking job at a big newspaper (copying addresses). It is there, however, where the intelligent Zaalberg learned the ropes of journalism, as well as English and French (by translating foreign newspaper articles and telegrams).
The editor in chief P.A. Daum, who was one of the most famous writers and journalists of the time, started to notice Zaalberg's talents and gave him more and more responsibilities. Daum, an autodidact himself, soon made Zaalberg his right-hand man, taking position against the widespread discrimination regarding Indos, who were seldom admitted to the highest layers of the colonial hierarchy. After Daum fell seriously ill Zaalberg replaced him successfully, but after the passing of his mentor the newspaper did not allow Zaalberg to replace him as editor in chief. The new chief editors failed miserably and the position remained vacant for a long time. Only after threatening to quit Zaalberg was appointed Chief Editor of the 'Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad'.
Meanwhile, Zaalberg had also emerged himself into politics and became a champion of the interests of the Indo Eurasians. His attention was focused on the acquisition of civil rights, including the right of political association and the right to vote, for native-born (Indo-)Europeans as well as educated Javanese and Chinese. He also published several articles on the need of education for the native population and increasing involvement in the government of the archipelago. The appointment of Ernest Douwes Dekker (an Indo like Zaalberg) as deputy editor in 1907 increased the political momentum of the 'Batavian Newspaper'. It had good contacts with young Javanese intellectuals and was actively involved in the formation of ‘Boedi Oetomo’ an event which is seen as the beginning of Indonesian nationalism. The close friendship between Douwes Dekker and Zaalberg initially led to joint plans with 'Budi Utomo' to aim for a parliament representing all native communities, including the Indo Eurasians.
Even though Zaalberg was opposed to the colonial policy of the Netherlands, that in his opinion seemed ignorant to the inevitable struggle for emancipation of the Indonesian peoples, Zaalberg was not a radical revolutionary. His sharp and biting criticism was always framed in a positivist worldview, in which gradual and reasonable development, also with regard to the colonial relationship, remained paramount. Unlike Dekker who in the tradition of his famous ancestor, the writer of 'Max Havelaar', did not hesitate to taunt the authorities. This is also where the radical Dekker and the moderate Zaalberg fell out and went their separate ways. Dekker went on to found the 'Indische Party' in 1912 and Zaalberg the 'Indo Europeesch Vebond' in 1919.
After his breakup with Dekker, coinciding with a temporary decline of his journalistic career and the death of his beloved wife, his health started failing. He still however experienced his finest hour when he acted as chairman at the founding meeting of the Indo-European Alliance (Dutch: ‘Indo Europeesch Verbond') in 1919. As board member of the 'IEV' he became a representative in the Dutch East Indies 'Volksraad' (House of Assembly), an infant form of local parliament, where he remained highly vocal about the need for native educational facilities. At age 53 he succumbed to his health issues. Under the leadership of his successor Dick de Hoog his 'IEV' would become the single most important Indo movement in the Dutch East Indies, with close to 15,000 members.
Although he is widely acknowledged as one of the great leaders driving the emancipation of the Indo community in Dutch ruled colonial society, his personal dream of building a large educated political Indo cadre that could lead the East Indies to independence was never realised. In fact in the end his biggest fear came to be. After further detrimental marginalisation the vulnerable Indo community was squashed in the inevitable clash between Dutch colonialism and the Indonesian independence movement.
Burton Crane (January 23, 1901 - February 3, 1963) was a New York Times correspondent on economics during the Occupation Period of Japan who also gained popularity as a singer in the same country, and was referred to as Japan's Bing Crosby.
He was a financial writer for the New York Times from 1937 - 1963. Aside from finance and writing as a foreign correspondent, Crane was a playwright and an instructor in economics. He was born in Buffalo, New York. The son of a Presbyterian minister, he graduated from Princeton University in 1922.
Following stints with several newspapers in the United States, Crane went to Tokyo in 1925, to become financial editor of the Japan Advertiser. He remained until 1936, and gained a reputation as an authority on the Japanese economy.
In 1945 he began service in the Far East with the Office of Strategic Services. At the conclusion of World War II Crane joined the Tokyo Bureau of the New York Times. He was wounded while covering the Korean War.
He directed six plays for the Tokyo International Players, five of which he wrote. He wrote additional plays and four books about financial subjects. Crane taught at New York University from 1952 to 1953. His book on the stock market, The Sophisticated Investor went through two editions and numerous reprintings. He completed Smart Money, which was published by Random House in 1964.
While working for the Japan Advertiser, he became well known as an unusual singer for Columbia Records, singing Japanese-language versions of popular Western songs of the day, becoming known as the "Bing Crosby of Japan".
His wife was Esther and transcripts exist of his recollections on the Occupation Period of Japan in the Columbia University Oral History Research Office.
The product of this gene is the polyamine oxidase. This enzyme potentially represents a new class of catabolic enzymes in the mammalian polyamine metabolic pathway capable of the efficient oxidation of polyamines. More than five transcript variants encoding four active isoenzymes have been identified for this gene, however, not all variants have been fully described. The characterized isoenzymes have distinctive biochemical characteristics and substrate specificities, suggesting the existence of additional levels of complexity in polyamine catabolism.

The Mohave and Milltown Railway was a 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge private railroad built in 1903 to serve the Leland Gold Mine near Oatman, Arizona, USA. The railway was incorporated in 1903 and construction of the 17-mile (27 km) line was completed that same year. The railway started on the Arizona side of the Colorado River, across the stateline from Needles, California. From the Colorado River the railway went northeast through Milltown and terminated at the Leland Mine, Vivian Mine and the Midnight Mine (near Oatman).
The railway was operating for only one year when several washouts in September and October 1904 damaged six miles (10 km) of the railway and led to its abandonment. The rails were removed in 1912, the same year that Arizona became a state.
A 4-6-0 tender engine from the Chateaugray Ore & Iron Works was also used on the line. After the M&M was shut down, the engine was left stranded when part of the line was washed out near U.S. Highway 66 and was left there to serve as a reminder of the old railroad to the hikers that walked around there, but no photographs have been taken of it there. It was recently dumped into the Mojave River near Needles to be used as an embankment against flood erosion.

It was separated from the Presbyterian Church in Uganda. In 1989 controversy arose over a case of church discipline. Attempt were made at reconciliation, but the new denomination the Reformed Presbyterian Church was formed in 1990. The center of the Church's activities is in Kampala, Uganda. The denomination is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches and the World Reformed Fellowship
The church had 5,000 members and dozens of congregations in 2004. The Reformed Presbyterian Church subscribes the Apostles Creed, Canons of Dort, Heidelberg Catechism, Westminster Confession and Westminster Larger Catechism.
The slang term little brown brother was used by Americans to refer to Filipinos during the period of U.S. colonial rule over the Philippines, following the Treaty of Paris between Spain and the United States, and the Philippine-American War. The term was coined by William Howard Taft, the first American Governor-General of the Philippines (1901–1904) and later the 27th President of the United States. U.S. military men in the Philippines greeted the term with scorn. The book Benevolent Assimilation recounts that Taft "assured President McKinley that 'our little brown brothers' would need 'fifty or one hundred years' of close supervision 'to develop anything resembling Anglo-Saxon political principles and skills.'", and reports that the military greeted Taft's assertion, "that 'Filipinos are moved by similar considerations to those which move other men' with utter scorn."
A 1961 book titled Little Brown Brother and subtitled "how the United States purchased and pacified the Philippine Islands at the century's turn", was awarded the 1962 Francis Parkman Prize by the American Historical Association as the best book in American history that year. A reissued 2001 edition of that book contains accounts of numerous atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers during the Philippine-American War.
The term was not originally intended to be derogatory, nor an ethnic slur; instead, it is a reflection of paternalist racism, shared also by Theodore Roosevelt.
The sharing of the Ganges waters between India and Bangladesh over the appropriate allocation and development of the water resources of the Ganges River that flows from northern India into Bangladesh. The issue has remained a subject of conflict for almost 35 years, with several bilateral agreements and rounds of talks failing to produce results.
However, a comprehensive bilateral treaty was signed by Indian Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed on 12 December 1996 in the Indian capital of New Delhi. The treaty established a 30-year water-sharing arrangement and recognised Bangladesh's rights as a lower-level riparian.
Descending from India's northern plains, the Ganges river forms a boundary of 129 kilometres between India and Bangladesh and flows for 113 km in Bangladesh. At Pakaur in India, the river begins its attrition with the branching away of its first distributary, the Bhagirathi River, which goes on to form the Hooghly River. About 10 kilometres from the border with Bangladesh the Farakka Barrage, built in 1974, controls the flow of the Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linking the Hooghly to keep it relatively silt-free.
After entering Bangladesh, the main branch of the Ganges is known as the Padma River until it is joined by the Jamuna River, the largest distributary of the Brahmaputra River, which descends from Assam and Northeast India. Further downstream, the Ganges is fed by the Meghna River, the second-largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, and takes on the Meghna's name as it enters the Meghna estuary. Fanning out into the 350 km wide Ganges Delta, it finally empties into the Bay of Bengal. A total of 54 rivers flow into Bangladesh from India.
The ex Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman signed the wide-ranging Indo-Bangladeshi Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace on 19 March 1972; as per the treaty, the two nations established a Joint River Commission to work for the common interests and sharing of water resources, irrigation, floods and cyclones control.
The Farakka Barrage is a dam on the Bhagirathi river located in the Indian state of West Bengal, roughly 10 km (6.2 mi) from the border with Bangladesh. India uses it to control the flow of the Ganges river. The dam was built to divert the Ganges River water into the Hooghly River during the dry season, from January to June, to flush out the accumulating silt which in the 1950s and 1960s was a problem at the Kolkata Port on the Hooghly River. Bangladesh claims that its rivers were drying up because of excess drawing of water by India. In May 1974 a joint declaration was issued to resolve the water–sharing issue before the Farakka Barrage began operation. This was followed by an interim agreement in 1975 to allow India to operate feeder canals of the barrage for short periods.
However, India withdrew from the process of negotiations by September 1976 as both nations grew apart after the killing of Sheikh Mujib and establishment of military rule. Bangladesh protested India's unilateral action at a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and at the 31st session of the U.N. General Assembly. At the urging of other nations and the U.N., both India and Bangladesh agreed to resume dialogue, but with no results.
Bilateral relations had improved in 1977 during the governments of the then-Prime Minister Morarji Desai of India and the then-President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh; in 1977 both leaders signed a 5-year treaty on water-sharing, but this duly expired in 1982 without being renewed.
Bangladesh attempted to internationalise the affair by lobbying the U.N. General Assembly and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) without result at all.
The formation of an Awami League government under Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the daughter of Sheikh Mujib, in 1996 led to a fresh thaw in bilateral relations and both nations restarted negotiations. Both leaders met in the Indian capital on 12 December 1996 and signed a 30-year, comprehensive treaty.
Both nations were able to co-operate in harnessing the water resources; the treaty also permits the construction of barrages and irrigation projects in Kushtia and the Gorai-Madhumati River in Bangladesh, draining the southwestern districts and thus preserving the environment, natural and economic resources.
The 1996 treaty established a long-term solution and considerably eased the strains in Indo-Bangladeshi relations. The 1996 treaty has been attacked by the Awami League's main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which is regarded as hostile to India, but it did not renege from the treaty when it came to power in 2001. The BNP and other Bangladeshi political factions allege that India is drawing excessive water and the amount allocated to Bangladesh is unjust and insufficient. India in turn complains that the water allocated to Bangladesh leaves it with less water than necessary for the functioning of the Kolkata Port and the National Thermal Power Corporation in Farakka.
Other critics have also stressed environmental reasons for India to reconsider its drawing of water at Farraka. Alarming increases in deforestation and erosion at the upper levels of the Ganges river increases the deposition of silt at the lower level, which is already measured at 2 million tonnes annually, along with increased salinity have also led to desertification. In Bangladesh, the diversion has raised salinity levels, contaminated fisheries, hindered navigation and posed a threat to water quality and public health. Such silt levels are believed to be adversely affecting the Hooghly river and the Kolkata Port.

Michael Harrison (born 21 December 1952) is an English former professional footballer who made 19 appearances in the Football League playing for Birmingham City and Southend United. He played as a centre half.
Harrison was born in Leicester, Leicestershire. When he left school in 1968 he joined Birmingham City as an apprentice, turning professional two years later. He captained Birmingham's youth team, and made his debut as an 18-year-old, deputising for Dave Robinson in a 4–1 win at Leicester City on 16 January 1971. He kept his place for the next game in the absence of Roger Hynd, and played once more the following season in place of Stan Harland. In the 1972 close season Harrison joined Southend United, where he spent one season and played 18 games in all competitions.
His next club was Yeovil Town of the Southern League. In the 1974–75 season, his second with the club, Harrison was named Player of the Year. The following season, under player-manager Stan Harland whom Harrison had understudied at Birmingham, the club achieved a "runners-up double" in the Southern League and the Southern League Cup, success which prompted invitation into the 1976–77 Anglo-Italian Semiprofessional Tournament, to play against Italian Serie C teams. Harrison was again named Player of the Season. In all competitions, he made 304 appearances for Yeovil Town over a six-year career.
This is a complete list of current members of the United States House of Representatives based on seniority. For the most part, representatives are ranked by the beginning of their terms in office. Representatives whose terms begin the same day are ranked alphabetically by last name.
Representatives who return to the House after having previously served in the House are credited with service equal to one less than the number of terms they served. For example, Rep. Steve Chabot had previously served seven terms, from 1995 to 2009, when he was once again elected in 2010. Instead of holding seniority with others whose terms began January 3, 2011, he was credited with six terms, and holds seniority above all representatives whose terms began January 3, 1999, and after. When a representative has served a prior term of fewer than two terms (i.e., prior term minus one equals less than one), he or she is ranked above all others whose service begins on the same day.
Committee chairmanship in the House is often associated with seniority, especially in the Democratic Caucus. The Republican leadership has a stronger hand in choosing committee chairs and ranking minority members, and does so based on voting records and campaign fundraising. Party leadership in the House is not strictly associated with seniority.

Léon Augustin Lhermitte (31 July 1844, Mont-Saint-Père – 28 July 1925, Paris) was a French realist painter and etcher whose primary subject matter was rural scenes depicting peasants at work.
Lhermitte’s innovative use of pastels won him the admiration of his contemporaries. Vincent van Gogh wrote that "If every month Le Monde Illustré published one of his compositions ... it would be a great pleasure for me to be able to follow it. It is certain that for years I have not seen anything as beautiful as this scene by Lhermitte ... I am too preoccupied by Lhermitte this evening to be able to talk of other things."
Lhermitte is represented in the collections of museums around the world, including Amsterdam, Boston, Brussels, Chicago, Florence, Montreal, Moscow, Paris, Rheims, and Washington.
Léon-Augustin Lhermitte's 'The Gleaners" (1887, Philadelphia Museum of Art). A part of the Realism movement and an avid realist painter, Lhermitte depicts the working class poverty in France. Taking very obvious inspiration from Millet, a painting of the same name, Lhermitte in a series of works displayed at the Salon aims to capture this moment in time. When comparing his work to Millet's, even the poses of the women are very similar if not the same. In the foreground there are two women bent over picking up the grains left behind, those that were not added into the hay stack which can be seen in the background. An obvious difference between this work and Millet's is that there is no large crowd of people working in the background.
Similarly though the women grasp the wheat in their hands on the left is shown a cache of what they have collected. This is vastly different from Millet's as his showed how little there was left. Lhermitte shows quite a bit of excess. When viewing the ground, identifying individual wheat grains is difficult if not impossible. This could be a representation of how difficult the work is, the endless task of gathering enough wheat to keep the families of these women fed. Around the same time the painting by Lhermitte was published and presented at the Salon, Millet's own "The Gleaners" was beginning to receive public appreciation. This led Lhermitte to continue painting scenes of rural France, many of which share the same name, "The Gleaners".
Looking closely at the individual gleaners, they are each given some individual "character". Rather than having plain smooth looking clothes like in Millet's painting, Lhermitte opted for looser fitting shirts and added more detail to the faces of the women. The second woman reaching down has a pained expression on her face, showing the effort of reaching down all day. While the women in Millet's painting share the same traits, the women in Lhermitte's have different expressions. The two standing women each hold their bundle as if they are taking a small break, while the woman at the far end has her hand on her back and an exacerbated look on her face. This piece leaves the viewer without a sense of closure, as it seems the day is just beginning and a hard day of work is still ahead.
Heiner Dopp (born 27 June 1956 in Bad Dürkheim, Rheinland-Pfalz) is a former field hockey player from West Germany, who competed at three Summer Olympics for his native country. He won the silver medal with his team, in 1984 (Los Angeles) and in 1988 (Seoul). Dopp made his Olympic debut in 1976 (Montreal).
He played 286 international matches for the national team, and won the German club title eight times with TG Frankenthal. After his hockey career he got engaged in local politics. In 1999 he became mayor of his home town Meckenheim.
The Vilnius Academy of Arts (Lithuanian: Vilniaus dailės akademija, previously State Art Institute of Lithuania) in Vilnius, Lithuania, grants a variety of degrees in the arts.
The Academy traces its roots back to the creation of the Architect Department at the University of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1793. The Department of Painting and Drawing was established in 1797, followed by the Department of Graphics (Engraving), and in 1805 – the Departments of Sculpture and History of art. In 1832, the University was temporarily closed, and reopened in 1919 with departments of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Art. In 1940, the art studies in Lithuania were united under Vilnius art institute and Kaunas art schools. Later, the Academy saw several re-organisations, and in 1990 the name of Vilnius Academy of Arts was reinstated.
"Just Might (Make Me Believe)" is a song recorded by American country music group Sugarland. It was released in September 2005 as the third single from their debut album Twice the Speed of Life. In addition, it was the only single of their career to be written solely by ex-member Kristen Hall, who left the group in early 2006.
A music video was released along with the song. It was shot completely in black and white, and features Jennifer Nettles roaming the countryside by herself, as well as all of the trio performing in a house.
Sir James Tyrrell (c. 1455 – 6 May 1502) was an English knight, a trusted servant of King Richard III of England. He is known for allegedly confessing to the murders of the Princes in the Tower under Richard's orders. William Shakespeare portrays Tyrrell as the man who organises the princes' murder in Richard III.
James Tyrrell was the eldest son of William Tyrrell of Gipping, Suffolk, and Margaret Darcy, the daughter of Robert Darcy of Maldon, Essex, and the grandson of Sir John Tyrrell.
Tyrrell's father was beheaded on Tower Hill on 23 February 1462, together with Sir Thomas Tuddenham and John Montgomery. John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and his eldest son and heir, Aubrey, were beheaded on 26 February and 20 February, respectively, after the discovery of an alleged plot to murder Edward IV. No records of the trials of the alleged conspirators have survived to shed light on what part, if any, Tyrrell's father played in the alleged conspiracy. He was not attainted, and his eldest son and heir's wardship and the custody of his lands were granted to Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, who sold them to William Tyrrell's widow in March 1463 for £50.
James Tyrrell fought on the Yorkist side at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, and was knighted there by Edward IV. A few months later he entered the service of the future Richard III, then Duke of Gloucester. After Richard III assumed power, he was appointed High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1484. He was in France in 1485, and played no part in the Battle of Bosworth Field which signalled the end of the Yorkists and the start of the Tudor dynasty.
In the following year, he returned to England and was pardoned by King Henry VII, who reappointed him governor of Guînes (in the English possession of Calais). However, in 1501, Tyrrell lent his support to Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, now the leading Yorkist claimant to the English throne, who was in voluntary exile. In the spring of 1501 Henry VII sent Thomas Lovell to Guînes to arrest Tyrrell and others, including Tyrrell's son, Thomas.
Tyrrell was charged with treason. Some years after his execution, Sir Thomas More in his "History of King Richard III" wrote that during his examination Tyrrell confessed to the murders of King Edward V of England and his brother Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York. According to More, he also implicated John Dighton as a perpetrator, and Dighton when questioned corroborated Tyrell's account. But he was unable to say where the bodies were, claiming that they had been moved. The original document of Tyrrell's alleged confession was never produced. However, other contemporary accounts, notably that of Polydore Vergil, make no mention of the confession.
Tyrrell was tried and convicted of treason at the Guildhall in London on 2 May 1502 and executed four days later, on 6 May, together with one of his accomplices in aiding Suffolk, Sir John Wyndham. Tyrrell was buried at the church of the Austin Friars, London. He was attainted on 25 January 1504; however the attainder was reversed three years later, on 19 April 1507.
In 1469, Tyrrell married Anne Arundel, the daughter of John Arundel of Lanherne, Cornwall, by his first wife, Elizabeth Morley, daughter of Thomas, Lord Morley, by whom he had three sons and a daughter:
Sir Thomas Tyrrell (d. 1551) of Gipping, Suffolk, who married firstly Margaret Willoughby, daughter of Christopher Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, by whom he had a son, Sir John Tyrrell (d. 1574), who married Elizabeth Munday, the daughter of Sir John Munday (d. 1537), Lord Mayor of London, and a daughter, Anne Tyrrell, who married Sir John Clere of Ormesby, Norfolk.
Anne Tyrrell, who married Sir Richard Wentworth (d. 1528) of Nettlestead, Suffolk, by whom she was the mother of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth.
In a television programme first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on 21 March 2015, the historian David Starkey announced his discovery in royal records that both Henry VII and his wife Elizabeth, the sister of Edward V and Richard Duke of York, were present throughout Tyrrell's trial.
Contemporary documents originally retrieved by scholar Rosemary Horrox record the king and queen were lodged in the Royal Apartments at the Tower during Tyrrell's trial, which was not held at the Tower itself. Starkey assumed this as validating More's account of Tyrrell's alleged confession and argued that it finally confirmed him as the man who oversaw the murder of the Queen's brothers, presumably at the behest of Tyrrell's overlord Richard III. However, the programme ended without any proof, other explanations or rebuttals being offered for Starkey's assumptions and speculations.

The Japanese Imperial Army had Independent Mixed Brigades that were composed of various units detached from other formations, or they independent support units formed together in an independent brigade. An Independent Mixed Brigade had about 5,000 to 11,000 troops.
The first two of these Independent Mixed Brigades formed by the Kwangtung Army in the 1930s were the IJA 1st Independent Mixed Brigade and the IJA 11th Independent Mixed Brigade. Each of these brigades were organized in a unique manner and one of them, the 11th was later formed into the IJA 26th Division.
Later a series of Independent Mixed Brigades were formed for the purpose of garrisoning the large territories of China captured in the early phase of the Second Sino-Japanese War. This variety for China was usually organized with five infantry battalions, an artillery unit, and labor troops. In the Pacific theater they had different and more varied configurations of subordinate units.

The Bradford Bulls Youth Development was the youth system of the rugby league club Bradford Bulls. It was one of the most famous and successful youth systems for rugby league and produced some of the best players in both rugby league and rugby union. The Bradford Bulls Youth Development consisted of three main teams, the Senior Academy, the Junior Academy and the Service Area team. Youth Development system also included scouting for the local area and education for the players in the academy teams.
The Senior Academy (from 2013 the Under 19's) was the highest tier in the Youth Development system. Any players under the age of 19 years were eligible to play for the senior academy; the rules also permitted three players over the age of 21 to play in academy matches. Most of the team was made up of fringe squad players and those first team players recovering from injury but also some of the best players from the junior academy were given experience in the senior academy. The Bradford Bulls Senior Academy was one of the best in the country and produced more professional Rugby League players than any other Academy in the country. The success of the Bradford Bulls Academy decreased in its latter years, many Senior Academy players were promoted to the first team squad at quite a young age and either secured a first team places or were released to other clubs. This meant that players from the junior academy players were drafted into the senior academy but were often playing against opposition much older than themselves.
Providence Sound Session is a "genre-defying" music festival held every July in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. It was established in 2004 by Providence Black Repertory Company artistic director, Donald King and Cliff Wood, then director of The City of Providence Department of Art, Culture, and Tourism.
The festival, a collaboration between non-profit and local government institutions, was originally held over the course of three days at Waterplace Park, Westminster Street and The Xxodus Café at Black Rep. It is now a week long and includes nineteen participating venues in and around Downtown Providence.
Inner Austria (German: Innerösterreich, Slovene: Notranja Avstrija, Italian: Austria Interiore) was a term used from the late 14th to the early 17th century for the Habsburg hereditary lands south of the Semmering Pass, referring to the Imperial duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola and the lands of the Austrian Littoral. The residence of the Inner Austrian archdukes and stadtholders was at the Burg castle complex in Graz.
The Inner Austrian territory stretched from the northern border with the Archduchy of Austria on the Alpine divide over Upper and Lower Styria down to Carniola, where the Lower and White Carniolan lands (the former Windic March) bordered on the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia. In the west, the Carinthian lands stretched to the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Habsburg County of Tyrol, while in the east, the Mur River formed the border with the Kingdom of Hungary.
In the south, the County of Görz, which had passed to the House of Habsburg in 1500, and Duino (Tybein) bordered on the Domini di Terraferma of Venice. The Imperial Free City of Trieste on the Adriatic Coast linked to assorted smaller possessions in the March of Istria around Pazin and the free port of Rijeka (later corpus separatum of Fiume) in Liburnia.
The Styrian lands had already been ruled in personal union by the Babenberg dukes of Austria since 1192 and were finally seized with the Austrian lands by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany upon his victory in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. In 1335 Rudolph's grandson Duke Albert II of Austria also received the Carinthian duchy with the adjacent March of Carniola at the hands of Emperor Louis the Bavarian as Imperial fiefs.
When in 1365 Albert's son Duke Rudolf IV of Austria suddenly died at the age of 26, Emperor Charles IV enfeoffed his younger brothers Albert III with the Pigtail and Leopold III the Just, who however began to quarrell about the Habsburg heritage. By the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg they finally split late Rudolf's territories: The elder Albertinian line would rule in the Archduchy of Austria proper (then sometimes referred to as "Lower Austria" (Niederösterreich), but comprising modern Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria), while the younger Leopoldian line ruled the Styrian, Carinthian and Carniolan duchies, then subsumed under the denotation of "Inner Austria". At that time their share also comprised Tyrol and the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia, called Further Austria; both collectively referred to as "Upper Austria" (Oberösterreich) in that context, also not to be confused with the modern state of that name.
When Leopold III was killed in the 1386 Battle of Sempach against the Old Swiss Confederacy, the Leopoldian heritage fell to his eldest son Duke William the Courteous, who upon the death of his uncle Albert III in 1395 also raised claims to the Archduchy of Austria against Albert's only son and heir Duke Albert IV. Both sides came to an agreement to maintain the Neuberg division but also to assert the common rule over the Habsburg lands. Therefore, from 1404 William acted as Austrian regent for his minor nephew Albert V. The Tyrolean and Further Austrian lands passed to William's younger brother Duke Leopold IV the Fat. When Duke William died without issue in 1406, the Leopoldian line was further split among his younger brothers: while Leopold IV assumed the regency in Austria, the Inner Austrian territories passed to Ernest the Iron, while the Tyrolean/Further Austrian passed to the youngest brother Frederick of the Empty Pockets.
In 1457 the Leopoldian line again could assume the rule over the Austrian archduchy, when Ernest's son Duke Frederick V of Inner Austria succeeded his Albertine cousin Ladislaus the Posthumous who had died without issue. 1490 saw the reunification of all Habsburg lines, when Archduke Sigismund of Further Austria and Tyrol resigned in favour of Frederick's son Maximilian I. In 1512, the Habsburg territories were incorporated into the Imperial Austrian Circle.
The dynasty however was split up again in 1564 among the children of deceased Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg. Under the Inner Austrian line founded by his younger son Archduke Charles II, the lands became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, carried out by the Jesuits with great determination. The cadet branch prevailed again, when Charles' son and successor as regent of Inner Austria, Archduke Ferdinand II, was crowned King of Bohemia in 1617, King of Hungary in 1618, and finally succeeded his cousin Matthias in the Archduchy of Austria (as Ferdinand III) and as Holy Roman Emperor in 1619. His intentions to translate the absolutist and anti-reformationist Inner Austrian policies to the Crown of Bohemia sparked the Thirty Years' War.
The Further Austrian/Tyrolean line of Ferdinand's younger brother Archduke Leopold V survived until the death of his son Sigismund Francis in 1665, whereafter all territories ultimately returned to common control with the other Austrian Habsburg lands. The political administration of Inner Austria was centralized at Graz in 1763. Inner Austrian stadtholders went on to rule until the days of Empress Maria Theresa in the 18th century.
The Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (abbreviated IIT Delhi or IITD) is a public engineering institution located in Hauz Khas, Delhi, India.
Established in 1961, with a vision to contribute to India and the world through excellence in scientific and technical education and research, to serve as a valuable resource for industry and society and to remain a source of pride for all Indians was formally inaugurated August 1961 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research & Cultural Affairs. First admissions were made in 1961. The current campus has an area of 320 acres (or 1.3 km²) and is bounded by the Sri Aurobindo Marg on the east, the Jawaharlal Nehru University Complex on the west, the National Council of Educational Research and Training on the south, and the New Ring Road on the north,and flanked by Qutub Minar and the Hauz Khas monuments.
The Institute was later decreed in Institutes of National Importance under the Institutes of Technology Amendment Act, 1963 and accorded the status of a Deemed University with powers to decide its own academic policy, to conduct its own examinations, and to award its own degrees.
The concept of the IITs was first introduced in a report in the year 1945 by Sh. N.M.Sircar, then member of Education on Viceroy's Executive Council. Following his recommendations, the first Indian Institute of Technology was established in the year 1950 in Kharagpur. In his report, Shri Sircar had suggested that such Institutes should also be started in different parts of the country. The Government having accepted these recommendations of the Sircar Committee decided to establish more Institutes of Technology with the assistance of friendly countries who were prepared to help. The first offer of help came from USSR who agreed to collaborate in the establishment of an Institute through UNESCO at Bombay. This was followed by the Institutes of Technology at Madras, Kanpur and Delhi with collaborations with West Germany, United States and UK respectively. Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati was established in 1995 and the University of Roorkee was converted into an IIT in 2001.
H.R.H. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh during his visit to India, laid the foundation stone of the College at Hauz Khas on January 28, 1959. The first admissions were made in 1961. The College was affiliated to the University of Delhi. The College of Engineering & Technology was registered as a Society on 14 June 1960 under the Societies Registration Act No. XXI of 1860 (Registration No. S1663 of 1960-61). The first admissions were made in 1961. The students were asked to report at the College on 16 August 1961 and the College was formally inaugurated on 17 August 1961 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research & Cultural Affairs. The College was affiliated to the University of Delhi. The college was later accorded the status of a University and was renamed as Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.
IIT Delhi offers Bachelor of Technology programs in various fields as well as dual degree B.Tech-cum-M.Tech programs. The admission to these programs is done through Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced.
IIT Delhi also offers postgraduate programs awarding M.Tech (by coursework), M.S. (by research), M.Sc., M. Des., MBA under various departments and centres. The admission to M.Tech and M.Des programs are carried out mainly based on Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). M.Sc. admissions are through Joint Admission Test for Masters (JAM) and MBA admissions are through Common Admission Test (CAT).
IIT Delhi is located in Hauz Khas, South Delhi. The campus of 325 acres (132 ha) is surrounded by the Hauz Khas area and monuments such as the Qutub Minar and Lotus Temple. The campus is also close to other educational institutions such as the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, National Institute of Fashion Technology, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and Indian Statistical Institute.

The chapter organises workshops and talks on different subjects by speakers who are well known in their area. These talks give students opportunities to learn about advanced research subjects. Apart from these, some non-technical activities are also organised. The IIT Delhi Chapter won the ACM Student Chapter Excellence Award for its Outstanding Activities during 2009–10. In 2012, the team of Rudradev Basak, Nikhil Garg, and Pradeep Mathias of IIT Delhi, achieved India's best ever rank at the ACM ICPC World Finals, by finishing 18th
Óttar of Dublin (or Óttarr of Dublin), in Irish Oitir Mac mic Oitir (Oitir the son of a son of Oitir), was a Hiberno-Norse King of Dublin, reigning in 1142–48. Alternative names used in modern scholarship include Óttar of the Isles and Óttar Óttarsson.
Óttar was a powerful man from the Norse-Gaelic territory of the Western Isles of Scotland, known as the Sudreyjar to the Vikings. He seized control of the Kingdom of Dublin in 1142, according to Clare Downham after having been invited by the townspeople to become their king. He is described as the grandson of Óttar in the Annals of the Four Masters and as the son of Óttar (McOtyr) in the Annals of Clonmacnoise. It is possible that both records are correct and that Óttar of Dublin was the son of a man named Óttar whose own father was also Óttar. Either his father or grandfather was the Jarl Óttar, killed in 1098, who is recorded as controlling half of the Isle of Man. One source unambiguously names Jarl Óttar of Man as the father of Óttar of Dublin, and also names his mother, one Svanhilda "a Danish lady." Before his takeover of Dublin he is not specifically mentioned as holding the title jarl, but his evident access to substantial military resources and the use of the title by both his forebears and descendants suggests that he was of that rank.
Óttar of Dublin belonged to what has been referred to as a 'dynasty of Óttars,' a family characterised by the repeated use of the personal name Óttar. Over a number of centuries its members were active throughout the Irish Sea zone, often in conjunction with the Uí Ímair, from Caithness in the far north of Scotland to Cork in the south of Ireland.
According to G. de P. Cotter, following his occupation of Dublin, Óttar "...burned the cathedral of Kells, and plundered that town. This most likely refers to the Church at Kells in County Meath, even though this church wasn't elevated to the status of "cathedral" until after the synod of Kells. The Annals of the Four Masters record that Kells ("Ceanannus") was burned in 1143 and three times in 1144.
Several versions of the Brut y Tywysogion record that an Óttar based in Dublin, and described as the "son of the other Óttar," was active fighting as a mercenary in Wales in 1144. This Óttar was either the king or, possibly, a son of the same name. The expedition to Wales was intended to support Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd against his brother Owain, king of Gwynedd. The force, transported by a fleet of vessels, landed at Abermenai in an attempt to force Owain to return Cadwaladr's lands. Relations with Cadwaladr apparently deteriorated and Óttar's men eventually took him hostage and demanded a ransom, the ransom being "two thousand slaves." Cadwaladr escaped from his erstwhile allies and made peace with his brother, who then forcibly induced the Dubliners to leave.
Contemporary annals suggest that Óttar was co-king with Ragnall mac Torcaill, until Ragnall was killed in a battle against the forces of Midhe (Meath) in 1145 or 1146: "A slaughter was made of the foreigners of Ath-cliath [Dublin] by the people of East Meath, where two hundred persons were slain, together with Raghnall Mac Torcaill, Mormaer of Ath-cliath, and Jufraigh, and many others of their chieftains." Raghnall was probably subordinate to Óttar. This is supported by the use of the title mormaer to describe Ragnall in the Annals of the Four Masters, though other annals call him king (in Irish "rí").
Óttar retained control of Dublin until 1148 when he was "treacherously killed" by the Meic Torcaill, the kin of Ragnall mac Torcaill. According to Downham, Óttar and the sons of Torcall initially co-operated, "...but a succession dispute emerged which led to Óttar's death in 1148.
He was married to Helga daughter of Tolokunger, a Danish commander, and was the father of Thorfinus filius Oter, who was described as the most powerful jarl (princeps) in the Western Isles.
He is claimed as an ancestor by the Cotter family of County Cork, Ireland, whose original name was Mac Oitir (son of Óttar), 'through Óttar's son Thorfin and grandson Therulfe.'
Óttar, the variant Irish spelling Otir is used, appears as a character in The Summer of the Danes by Ellis Peters in the Brother Cadfael series. The book uses Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd's attempt to reclaim his lands with the help of a "Danish" fleet as the background to the plot.

The Public Library of Lleida (Catalan: Biblioteca Pública de Lleida), also formerly called Biblioteca Pública de la Maternitat, is a public library in the city of Lleida (Catalonia, Spain). Its legal owner is the Generalitat de Catalunya. The building was originally a 19th-century maternity house, that is, an orphanage located in the Rambla d'Aragó and has operated as the town's main library since 1998, when it was heavily reformed.
It contains over 150,000 books and 9,760 printed documents from the 16th to the 19th century, 6 manuscripts and 25 incunables. The library's two cloysters are often used for artistic and cultural exhibitions, often related to local artists or focusing on social issues, including one in 1998 on its own past as an orphanage.
In 1926, Kluyver and Hendrick Jean Louis Donker published the now classic paper, "Die Einheit in der Biochemie" ("Unity in Biochemistry"). The paper helped establish Kluyver's vision that, at a biochemical level, all organisms are unified. Kluyver famously expressed the idea with the aphorism: "From elephant to butyric acid bacterium – it is all the same". The paper, and other work from Kluyver's lab, helped support both the concept of biochemical unity as well as the idea of "comparative biochemistry", which Kluyver envisioned as biochemically equivalent to comparative anatomy. The concept established a theoretical basis for studying chemical processes in bacteria and extrapolating those processes to higher organisms.
The concepts of "biochemical unity" and "comparative biochemistry" were both very influential and probably Kluyver's most significant work. Kluyver's best known student, C. B. van Niel, commented on his mentor's scientific influence and noted that by the middle of the 20th century his work on biochemical unity was no longer cited. His aphorism was sufficiently widespread that in 1961 François Jacob and Jacques Monod paraphrased it, without mentioning Kluyver, as "that old axiom 'what is true for bacteria is also true for elephants'" to justify the genetic code's universality. Unfortunately, his career was profoundly influenced by World War II and the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.
Kluyver is associated with the Delft school of microbiology. In 1926 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is considered the father of comparative microbiology, and in 1953 won the Copley medal.
Gandy, son of James Gandy, was probably born in Ireland. For some years he was an itinerant painter in Devon and the west of England. He went to Plymouth in 1714, and eventually settled in Exeter. According to Northcote, whose grandfather and father knew and befriended Gandy:
He was a man of a most untractable disposition, very resentful, of unbounded pride, and in the latter part of his life both idle and luxurious; of which I remember to have heard many instances from my father who knew him, and whose portrait he painted when a child.
He was at all times totally careless of his reputation as a painter; and more particularly so if any thing happened in the course of his business to displease him.
He liked people to think that he was a natural son of his father's patron, the Duke of Ormonde, and that he was so much concerned in the duke's affairs that he was not able to make a public appearance in London.
His portraits, though sometimes slight and sketchy, showed real genius, and were frequently admired by great artists. The portrait of the Rev. Tobias Langdon in the college hall at Exeter excited the admiration of Sir Godfrey Kneller. Gandy may also be credited with having directed and stimulated the rising genius of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Reynolds saw Gandy's pictures early in life, and they made a great impression on his mind; he, like Northcote, often borrowed one of Gandy's portraits, probably the Langdon portrait, to study.
He painted Northcote's grandmother, the Rev. Nathaniel Harding of Plymouth, the Rev. John Gilbert, vicar of St. Andrew's, Plymouth (engraved by Vertue as a frontispiece to Gilbert's Sermons), John Patch, surgeon in the Exeter Hospital, the Rev. William Musgrave (engraved by Michael van der Gucht), Sir Edward Seaward in the chapel of the poorhouse at Exeter, Sir William Elwill, and others. Gandy frequently left his pictures to be finished by others. He died in Exeter, and was buried in St. Paul's Church on 14 July 1729.

Lefebvre was born in Tournan-en-Brie, Seine-et-Marne, on 14 March 1836. He entered the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in 1852 and was a pupil of Léon Cogniet.
He won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1861. Between 1855 and 1898, he exhibited 72 portraits in the Paris Salon. In 1891, he became a member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts.
He was professor at the Académie Julian in Paris. Lefebvre is chiefly important as an excellent and sympathetic teacher who numbered many Americans among his 1500 or more pupils. Among his famous students were Fernand Khnopff, Kenyon Cox, Félix Vallotton, Ernst Friedrich von Liphart, Georges Rochegrosse, the Scottish-born landscape painter William Hart, Walter Lofthouse Dean, and Edmund C. Tarbell, who became an American Impressionist painter. Another pupil was the miniaturist Alice Beckington.
Many of his paintings are single figures of beautiful women. Among his best portraits were those of M. L. Reynaud and the Prince Imperial (1874).
1870 La Vérité (The Truth) (1870), oil on canvas, Musée d'Orsay, Paris. The painting is contemporary with the first small scale model made by Lefebvre's fellow-Frenchman Frédéric Bartholdi for what became the Statue of Liberty, striking a similar pose, though fully clothed.

David Alasdair Boudia (born April 24, 1989) is an American diver. He won the gold medal in the 10 metre platform diving competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and the bronze medal in the same event at the 2016 Summer Olympics. He has also won a silver medal in the men's synchronized 10 metre platform with Steele Johnson at the 2016 Olympics, and a bronze with Nick McCrory at the 2012 Olympics.
Born in Abilene, Texas, Boudia's parents are Jim and Sheilagh Boudia. He graduated from Noblesville High School in 2007, and attended Purdue University. He resides in West Lafayette, Indiana.
He started diving in 2000, and has been a member of the U.S. National Diving Team since 2005. Boudia once stated that a dive from the great height of an Olympic 10-meter platform once 'petrified' him.
Boudia was named to the 2008 U.S. Olympic team in the 10-meter platform and in the synchronized 10-meter platform event with former synchro partner Thomas Finchum. Boudia and Finchum were 2009 World Championship (Rome) Silver Medalists, and 2007 World Championship (Melbourne) Bronze Medalists. His past synchro partner is Nick McCrory. They are the 2012 Olympic Bronze Medalists.
He is the winner of the Big 10 Male Tower Diving event at the Big Ten Tournament, held in 2010 at Ohio State. He is the first American to break 600 points in six dives.
In his first event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Boudia and his partner, Nicholas McCrory, won the bronze in the synchronized 10 metre platform with a total score of 463.47, finishing behind China (486.78) and Mexico (468.90). It was the first Olympic medal for the United States in men's diving since the 1996 games in Atlanta. The United States had not made the podium in diving at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.
In his second event, the 10 metre platform, Boudia barely advanced from the prelims placing eighteenth but then went on to finish third in the semi-finals to advance to the finals. In the sixth and last round, Boudia won gold with a total score of 568.65, finishing ahead of world champion Qiu Bo (566.85) and hometown favourite Tom Daley (556.95). It was the first Olympic gold for the United States in diving since the 2000 Summer Olympics, when Laura Wilkinson won the gold in the women's 10-meter platform competition; the first Olympic gold in the 10-meter platform competition by an American male diver since Greg Louganis achieved that feat at the 1988 Summer Olympics (also taking the 3-meter springboard title); and the first Olympic diving gold for an American man since Mark Lenzi's victory in the 3-meter springboard competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics.
Boudia partnered with Steele Johnson in the synchronized 10-meter platform dive at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. They won a silver behind the Chinese pair Chen Aisen and Lin Yue. In the individual 10 metre platform event, Boudia won a bronze.
After the Olympics, Boudia decided in 2017 to take a break from international competition before making a decision on whether to retire or return for a fourth Olympics.
Boudia became a Christian in 2010 through the influence of his college diving coach Adam Soldati. He openly referenced his religious beliefs in several interviews before, during, and after the 2012 Olympics. In 2012, Boudia married Sonnie Brand, whom he met while studying at Purdue University. In October 2014, Boudia and his wife welcomed their first child, Dakoda. On August 24, 2017, Boudia announced the birth of his second daughter, Mila Primm Boudia.
The Avim, Avvim (Hebrew: עוים‎) or Avvites of Philistia in the Old Testament were a people dwelling in Hazerim, or "the villages" or "encampments", on the south-west corner of the sea-coast. Their name is first used in Deuteronomy 2:23 in a description of the conquests that had taken place in the Land of Israel during the Israelite sojourn in Egypt. The passage relates that they were conquered by the Caphtorites who usurped their land.
A trace of them is afterwards found in Joshua 13:3. These verses mentions that their land was considered part of the Canaanite land to be conquered by the Israelites:
... and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.
While the Philistines at the time of the Judges and the monarchy are understood to be predominantly descended from the invading Caphtorites, the Talmud (Chullin 60b) notes that the Avim were part of the Philistine people in the days of Abraham and records that they originated from Yemen. The Table of Nations in Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1 also mentions Philistines coming from the Casluhim. As part of the earlier Philistines they were subjects of Abimelech who ruled from Gerer. Because of an oath that Abaraham had sworn to Abimelech the Israelites were not originally permitted to conquer their land, but after the Caphtorites had usurped them, the oath was no longer valid.
David Rohl surmises that after the Inachids were conquered by Caphtor the Avim, whom he identifies as Aamu, moved to adopt Hathor as patron setting themselves up in lesser Hyksos Egypt as petty rulers such as Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and Ammu Aahotepre. He suggests Ahhotep II who drove the Greater Hyksos Caphtorim out of Egypt was an important descendant of this earlier Palestinian group and became the inspiration behind the legend of Io.
This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, which is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim.

Anna Seghers' novel The Seventh Cross (German: Das siebte Kreuz), is one of the better-known examples of German literature circa World War II. It was published first in the United States, in an abridged version, in September 1942 by Little, Brown and Company. Its publication was surrounded by a certain amount of fanfare; by the end of September, there were already plans for a comic strip version of The Seventh Cross, it having already been selected as a Book-of-the-Month Club book.
According to Dorothy Rosenberg, who wrote the afterword for the 1987 Monthly Review Press edition, statistics indicate that 319,000 copies of The Seventh Cross were sold in the first twelve days alone, and the novel was printed in German, Russian, Portuguese, Yiddish and Spanish by 1943. A film version starring Spencer Tracy and produced by MGM premiered in 1944; a publicity stunt, in which MGM organized a pretend "manhunt" for a Tracy look-alike in seven cities for the public to take part in, accompanied the normal film promotions. The book was well received in Germany, and particularly in the East; the author, Seghers, was known to be a Communist, and some of the "heroic" or sympathetic characters in The Seventh Cross are also members of the Communist Party.
The story of Das siebte Kreuz is rather simple: there are seven men who have been imprisoned in the fictitious Westhofen camp, who have decided to make a collaborative escape attempt. The main character is a Communist, George Heisler; the narrative follows his path across the countryside, taking refuge with those few who are willing to risk a visit from the Gestapo, while the rest of the escapees are gradually overtaken by their hunters.
The title of the book comes from a conceit of the prison camp. The current officer in charge has ordered the creation of these seven crosses from the trees nearby, to be used when the prisoners are returned - not for crucifixion, but a subtler torture: the escapees are made to stand all day in front of their crosses, and will be punished if they falter.

Ebrahimabad (Persian: ابراهيم اباد‎, also Romanized as Ebrāhīmābād) is a village in Shabeh Rural District, Jangal District, Rashtkhvar County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 204, in 40 families.
This was the first America studio album following the departure of Dan Peek, the first America release on Capitol Records, and the last to feature George Martin as producer.
It was also their first studio album since their debut to have a title beginning with a letter other than "H". The title itself acknowledges the missing "H" by its wry reference to silent letters in the English language.
The album was not a commercial success, reaching only number 110 on the Billboard album chart. It did produce three minor hit singles. "Only Game in Town" reached 107 on the Billboard singles chart; "All My Life" (number 48 on the Adult Contemporary chart) was a big hit in Asia; and "All Around" hit number 45 on the Adult Contemporary chart.
In his Allmusic retrospective review, music critic Steven Thomas Erlewine noted the band's transition from "folky California soft rock" to adult contemporary. He wrote of the album: "The end result may be flawed, but in an enjoyable way. And compared to the records that preceded it and some of albums that followed it, Silent Letter certainly seems like a latter-day highlight for America."
Revillagigedo Island (locally Revilla ) is an island in the Alexander Archipelago in Ketchikan Gateway Borough of the southeastern region of the U.S. state of Alaska. Running about 89 km (50 mi) north-south and 48 km (35 mi) east-west, it is 2,754.835 km² (1,063.65 mi²) in area, making it the 12th largest island in the United States and the 167th largest island in the world. Its center is located near 55°38′03″N 131°17′51″W.
The island is separated from the Alaska mainland to the east by Behm Canal, from Prince of Wales Island to the west by the Clarence Strait, and from Annette Island to the south by Revillagigedo Channel and Nichols Passage. The island is traditional Tlingit territory, and by the nineteenth century was divided between the Saanyaa Ḵwáan and Taantʼa Ḵwáan tribes or subdivisions. The first European recorded as having sighted it was Spanish explorer Jacinto Caamaño in 1792; it was named the following year by George Vancouver for Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, then viceroy of New Spain (Mexico).
The island's population was 13,950 as of the 2000 census. The only cities on the island are Ketchikan and Saxman, although the unincorporated community of Ward Cove and the historical community of Loring are also on the island. The principal industries are fishing, canning, logging and tourism. In addition to the cities, several logging communities are based on barges, which move about the waterways. These serve the unconnected system of logging roads that dot the island and have access to waterfront.
Revillagigedo Island: Blocks 1075 to 1112, 1115 to 1120, 1122 and 1123, 1127 to 1130, 1137 to 1143, Block Group 1; and Block Groups 2 to 4, Census Tract 1; Census Tracts 2 to 4; Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska United States Census Bureau
The FIA World Endurance Championship is an auto racing world championship organized by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The series supersedes the ACO's former Intercontinental Le Mans Cup which began in 2010, and is the first endurance series of world championship status since the demise of the World Sportscar Championship at the end of 1992. The World Endurance Championship name was previously used by the FIA from 1981 to 1985.
The series features multiple classes of cars competing in endurance races, with sports prototypes competing in the Le Mans Prototype categories, and production-based grand tourers competing in the LM GTE categories. World champion titles are awarded to the top scoring manufacturers and drivers over the season, while other cups and trophies will be awarded for drivers and private teams.
The World Endurance Championship follows much of the format of the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup and features nine endurance races across the world, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with all races being at least six hours in duration. The calendar includes four races in Europe, two in the Americas, two in Asia and one in the Middle East, with a possible future expansion. There are four categories: LMP1 and LMP2 prototypes and the GTE category, divided into GTE Pro for teams with professional driver line-ups, and GTE Am for teams featuring a mixture of amateur drivers.
Six titles are awarded each season based on total point tally, with two being deemed world championships: Manufacturers' World Endurance Champion and Drivers' World Champion. The GTE Pro class champion are awarded a World Cup, while the leaders in LMP2 and GTE Am are awarded a Trophy. The final Trophy is awarded to the best privateer team amongst all four classes. The points system is similar to that used in the FIA's other world championships, awarding points to the top ten finishers on a sliding point margin scale from first to tenth. Cars finishing the race but classified eleventh or further are awarded a half point. Double points are awarded for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
The main dominating feature is seen in the castle from the 16th century that was built firstly in the Renaissance style and in the 17th century rebuilt and enriched with the Baroque attributes.
The ship was laid down in 1940 as the fishing dragger Harriet N. Eldridge, acquired by the U.S. Navy on 4 November 1940, and placed in service as Flamingo on 6 June 1941.
She was redesignated and reclassified as the Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary, IX-180 on 17 July 1944. Flamingo was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 January 1946. Fate unknown.
Chiswick Park Cricket Ground was a cricket ground in Chiswick, London (formerly Middlesex). The first recorded match on the ground was in 1886, when Chiswick Park played the Parsees during their tour of England.
The first first-class match held on the ground came in 1886 when CI Thornton's XI played the touring Australians. The second and final first-class match held at the ground came in 1887 when Middlesex played Oxford University.
The final recorded match held on the ground came in 1888 when the Gentlemen of West Middlesex played the Parsees during their tour of England. The ground was located to the north of the Hounslow Loop Line and was surrounded to the west by Grove Park Terrace, to the north by Fauconberg Road and to the west by Sutton Court Road. Following the Second World War, the ground was built over, with a primary school and apartments built on it.
Ceephax Acid Crew (real name Andy Jenkinson) is a British acid techno and drum and bass electronic musician. Jenkinson is also known simply by the pseudonym Ceephax, which is a reference to the BBC teletext service Ceefax. He is the brother of Squarepusher (Tom Jenkinson).
Ceephax's music from 1997 to 2002 and beyond used mainly vintage (especially Roland) drum machines and synthesizers such as the TB-303. This music was often recorded onto a cassette tape deck. The music was released on vinyl records and cassette tape on underground labels such as Breakin' Records, Lo Recordings and Firstcask. This primitive Acid House aesthetic and methodology countered the growing popularity of the computer music and compact disc releases of the time. Rephlex Records and Warp Records also released remixes of Squarepusher by Ceephax around this time.
From 2003 onwards as well as his more typical Acid style he has also released drum and bass songs made on old samplers, a Commodore Amiga and various early digital synthesizers, again displaying an interest in late 1980s and early 1990s dance music. His set on Mary Anne Hobb's show Breezeblock in 2003 and more recent tracks such as "Castilian" and "Arcadian" also indicate an interest in Chiptune music.
From 2007 he has had full releases on the Rephlex and Planet Mu record labels. He also continues to release on Firstcask and other small independent labels such as WéMè, Bugklinik and his own label Waltzer.
Ceephax is popular with some electronic music fans for his live performances. Ceephax's shows are set apart from the popular Laptop style of "live" electronic performance by exclusively using only analogue and early digital equipment and occasionally an Amiga computer. These sets range from old school house, acid house, techno, drum and bass and gabber all in Ceephax's distinctive style. He has also produced several music videos predominantly using old video equipment and early computer animation.
Das Qaleh (Persian: داس قلعه‎, also Romanized as Dās Qal‘eh) is a village in Kuhin Rural District, in the Central District of Kabudarahang County, Hamadan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 1,349, in 270 families.
The Turkey Devonshire sandwich, sometimes simply called a Devonshire, originated in 1934 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is typically served as a hot open faced sandwich on toasted bread with hot turkey, bacon, tomatoes, and a cheese sauce. The sandwich is similar to a Kentucky Hot Brown.
It was created by Frank Blandi (1907-1999), a Sicilian American, who first served them at the Stratford Club located at the corner of Centre Ave. and Millvale Ave. on the border between Pittsburgh's Bloomfield and Shadyside neighborhoods. The club had an English atmosphere and the sandwich was named after the classy sounding Devonshire St. which is one block away.
Note that several of these accounts, including the obituary, wrongly state that the Stratford Club was located in the Millvale borough of Allegheny County rather than on Millvale Ave. in the Bloomfield neighborhood.
PowerDNS is a DNS server, written in C++ and licensed under the GPL. It runs on most Unix derivatives. PowerDNS features a large number of different backends ranging from simple BIND style zonefiles to relational databases and load balancing/failover algorithms. A DNS recursor is provided as a separate program.
PowerDNS was originally a commercial proprietary product. In November 2002, the source code was made public under the open-source GPL v2 license.
PowerDNS Authoritative Server (pdns_server) consists of a single core, and multiple dynamically loadable backends that run multi-threaded. The core handles all packet processing and DNS intelligence, while one or more backends deliver DNS records using arbitrary storage methods.
Zone transfers and update notifications are supported, and the processes can run unprivileged and chrooted. Various caches are maintained to speed up query processing. Run-time control is available through the pdns_control command, which allows reloading of separate zones, cache purges, zone notifications and dumps statistics in Multi Router Traffic Grapher / rrdtool format. Realtime information can also be obtained through the optional built-in web server.
There are many independent projects to create management interfaces for PowerDNS, including PowerAdmin, PDNSOps, PowerDNS on rails and JPower Admin and even a drupal module called PowerAdmin.
The PowerDNS Authoritative Server supports DNSSEC as of version 3.0. While pre-signed zones can be served, it is also possible to perform online signing & key management. This has the upside of being relatively easy, but the downside that the cryptographic keying material is present on the servers itself (which is also true of any HTTPS server when not used with a HSM for example).
This part of PowerDNS is single threaded, but is written as if it were multi-threaded, by the use of Boost and the MTasker library, which is a simple cooperative multitasking library. It is also available as a standalone package.
It does not have to run a pdns_server process as a gatekeeper for pdns_recursor, if the goal is simply to provide caching/recursing/resolving nameservice as running pdns_recursor on its own is even more efficient than behind the authoritative component.
The .30-06 Springfield cartridge (pronounced "thirty-aught-six" or "thirty-oh-six"), 7.62×63mm in metric notation and called ".30 Gov't '06" by Winchester, was introduced to the United States Army in 1906 and later standardized; it remained in use until the early 1980s. The ".30" refers to the caliber of the bullet. The "06" refers to the year the cartridge was adopted—1906. It replaced the .30-03, 6mm Lee Navy, and .30-40 Krag cartridges. The .30-06 remained the U.S. Army's primary rifle and machine gun cartridge for nearly 50 years before being replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO (commercial .308 Winchester) and 5.56×45mm NATO, both of which remain in current U.S. and NATO service. It remains a very popular sporting round, with ammunition produced by all major manufacturers.
In the early 1890s, the U.S. military adopted the smokeless powder .30-40 Krag rimmed cartridge. The 1894 version of that cartridge used a 220-grain (14 g) round-nose bullet. Around 1901, the U.S. started developing an experimental rimless cartridge for a Mauser action with box magazine. That led to the 1903 .30-03 rimless service round that used the same 220-grain (14 g) round-nose bullet as the Krag. The .30-03 achieved a muzzle velocity of 2,300 ft/s (700 m/s).
Many European militaries at the turn of the 20th century were adopting lighter-weight (roughly 150-to-200-grain (9.7 to 13.0 g)), higher velocity, service rounds with pointed (spitzer) bullets: France in 1898 (8mm Lebel Balle D spitzer 198 grains (12.8 g) with boat-tail), Germany in 1903 (7.92×57mm Mauser 153 grains (9.9 g) S Patrone), Russia in 1908 (7.62×54mmR Lyokhkaya pulya [Light Bullet]), and Britain in 1910 (.303 British Mark VII 174 grains (11.3 g)). Consequently, the round-nosed U.S. .30-03 service cartridge was falling behind.
For these reasons, the U.S. military developed a new, lighter, cartridge in 1906, the .30-06 Springfield, "Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30, Model of 1906", or just M1906. The .30-03 case was modified to have a slightly shorter neck to fire a spitzer flat-based 150-grain (9.7 g) bullet that had a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.405, a muzzle velocity of 2,700 ft/s (820 m/s), and a muzzle energy of 2,429 ft⋅lbf (3,293 J). The cartridge was loaded with Military Rifle (MR) 21 propellant, and its maximum range was claimed (falsely) to be 4,700 yd (4,300 m). The M1903 Springfield rifle, which had been introduced alongside the .30-03 cartridge, was modified to accept the new .30-06 Springfield cartridge. Modifications to the rifle included shortening the barrel at its breech and resizing the chamber, so that the more tapered bullet would not have to jump too far to reach the rifling. Other changes to the rifle included elimination of the troublesome "rod bayonet" of the earlier Springfield rifles.
The M1906 maximum range was originally overstated. When the M1906 cartridge was developed, the range tests had been done to only 1,800 yards (1,650 m); distances beyond that were estimated, but the estimate for extreme range was wrong by almost 40 percent. The range discrepancy became evident during World War I. Before the widespread employment of light mortars and artillery, long-range machine gun "barrage" or indirect fires were considered important in U.S. infantry tactics. When the US entered World War I, it did not have many machine guns, so it acquired British and French machine guns. When those weapons were later replaced with US machine guns firing the M1906 round, the effective range of the barrage was 50 percent less. Firing tests performed around 1918 at Borden Brook Reservoir (Massachusetts), Miami, and Daytona Beach showed the actual maximum range of the M1906 cartridge to be 3,300 to 3,400 yards (3,020 to 3,110 m). Germany, which was using the S Patrone (S ball cartridge) loaded with a similar 153-grain (9.9 g) flat-based bullet in its rifles, had apparently confronted and solved the same problem by developing an aerodynamically more refined bullet for long range machine gun use. The s.S. Patrone was introduced in 1914 and used a 197.5-grain (12.80 g) s.S. - schweres Spitzgeschoß ("heavy spitzer") boat-tail bullet which had a maximum range of approximately 5,140 yd (4,700 m).
For these reasons, in 1926, the Ordnance Corps after extensive testing of 7.5×55mm Swiss GP11 projectiles provided by the Swiss developed the .30 M1 Ball cartridge loaded with a new Improved Military Rifle (IMR) 1185 propellant and 174-grain (11.3 g) bullet with a 9° boat tail and an ogive of 7 calibers that had a higher ballistic coefficient of roughly 0.494 (G1 BC), that achieved a muzzle velocity of 2,647 ft/s (807 m/s) and muzzle energy of 2,675 ft⋅lbf (3,627 J). This bullet further reduced air resistance in flight, resulting in less rapid downrange deceleration, less lateral drift caused by crosswinds, and significantly greater supersonic and maximum effective range from machine guns and rifles alike. Its maximum range was approximately 5,500 yd (5,030 m). Additionally, a gilding metal jacket was developed that all but eliminated the metal fouling that plagued the earlier M1906 cartridge.
Wartime surplus totaled over 2 billion rounds of ammunition. Army regulations called for training use of the oldest ammunition first. As a result, the older .30-06 ammunition was expended for training; stocks of .30 M1 Ball ammunition were allowed to slowly grow until all of the older M1906 ammunition had been fired. By 1936, it was discovered that the maximum range of the .30 M1 Ball ammunition with its boat-tailed spitzer bullets was beyond the safety limitations of many ranges. An emergency order was made to manufacture quantities of ammunition that matched the external ballistics of the earlier M1906 cartridge as soon as possible. A new cartridge was developed in 1938 that was essentially a duplicate of the old M1906 round, but loaded with IMR 4895 propellant and a new flat-based bullet that had a gilding metal jacket and a different lead alloy, and weighed 152 grains (9.8 g) instead of 150 grains (9.7 g). This 1938 pattern cartridge, the Cartridge, Caliber .30, Ball, M2 achieved a muzzle velocity of 2,805 ft/s (855 m/s) and muzzle energy of 2,656 ft⋅lbf (3,601 J). The round weighed 416 grains (27.0 g) and its maximum range was approximately 3,450 yd (3,150 m).
In military service, the 30-06 was used in the bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifle, the bolt-action M1917 Enfield rifle, the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle, the semi-automatic M1941 Johnson rifle, the Famage Mauser, the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and numerous machine guns, including the M1917 and M1919 series. It served the United States in both World Wars and in the Korean War, its last major use being in Vietnam.
The Belgian army (ABL) bought the FN Model 1949 rifle in 30-06 calibre (both as a sniper version with telescopic sights and as a general service weapon). The Belgium armed forces used the round widely in the Korean war, where the 30-06 calibre FN-49 proved to be a superior weapon in terms of both accuracy and reliability to the American M1 Garand. The 30-06 FN-49 saw widespread use in the various wars in and around the Belgian Congo. The 30-06 FN-49 was also sold to the armies of Luxembourg, Indonesia and Colombia. Another customer was Brazil where it served the Navy.
Large volumes of surplus brass made it the basis for dozens of commercial and wildcat cartridges, as well as being extensively used for reloading. In 1908 the Model 1895 Winchester lever-action rifle became the first commercially produced sporting rifle chambered in .30-06 Springfield. It is still a very common round for hunting and is suitable for large game such as bison, Sambar deer, and bear, when used at close to medium ranges.
In 1903, the Army converted its M1900 Gatling guns in .30 Army to fit the new .30-03 cartridge as the M1903. The later M1903-'06 was an M1903 converted to .30-06. This conversion was principally carried out at the Army's Springfield Armory arsenal repair shops. All models of Gatling guns were declared obsolete by the U.S. Army in 1911, after 45 years of service.
Ballistically, the .30-06 is one of the most versatile cartridges ever designed. With "hot" handloads and a rifle capable of handling them, the .30-06 is capable of performance rivaling many "magnum" cartridges. On the other hand, when loaded more closely to the original government spec, .30-06 remains within the upper limit of felt recoil most shooters consider 'tolerable' over multiple rounds, unlike the magnums, and isn't unnecessarily destructive of meat on game such as deer. With appropriate loads, it is suitable for any small or large heavy game found in North America. The .30-06's power and versatility (combined with the availability of surplus firearms chambered for it and demand for commercial ammunition) have kept the round as one of the most popular for hunting in North America.
The .30-06 cartridge was designed when shots of 1,000 yards (900 m) were expected. In 1906, the original M1906 .30-06 cartridge consisted of a 150 grains (9.7 g), flat-base cupronickel-jacketed-bullet. After World War I, the U.S. military needed better long-range performance machine guns. Based on weapons performance reports from Europe, a streamlined, 173 grains (11.2 g) boattail, gilding-metal bullet was used. The .30-06 cartridge, with the 173 grains (11.2 g) bullet was called Cartridge, .30, M1 Ball. The .30-06 cartridge was far more powerful than the smaller Japanese 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge and comparable to the Japanese 7.7×58mm Arisaka. The new M1 ammunition proved to be significantly more accurate than the M1906 round.
In 1938, the unstained, 9.8 grams (151 gr), flat-base bullet combined with the .30-06 case became the M2 ball cartridge. The M2 Ball specifications required 2,740 feet per second (840 m/s) minimum velocity, measured 78 feet (24 m) from the muzzle. M2 Ball was the standard-issue ammunition for military rifles and machine guns until it was replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO round in 1954. For rifle use, M2 Ball ammunition proved to be less accurate than the earlier M1 cartridge; even with match rifles, a target group of 5 inches (130 mm) diameter at 200 yards (180 m) using the 150-grain (9.7 g) M2 bullet was considered optimal, and many rifles did not perform nearly as well. The U.S. Marine Corps retained stocks of M1 ammunition for use by snipers and trained marksmen throughout the Solomon Islands campaign in the early years of the war.
In an effort to increase accuracy some snipers resorted to use of the heavier .30-06 M2 armor-piercing round, a practice that re-emerged during the Korean War. Others sought out lots of M2 ammunition produced by Denver Ordnance, which had proved to be more accurate than those produced by other wartime ammunition plants when used for sniping at long range. With regards to penetration, the M2 ball can penetrate 0.4 in (10.16 mm) of mild steel at 100 yards (91 m), and 0.3 in (7.62 mm) at 200 yards (180 m). M2 AP can penetrate 0.42 in (10.67 mm) of armor steel at 100 yards (91 m). These figures come from army documents. However, a test done by Brass Fetchers shows that M2 AP can actually penetrate up to 0.5 in (12.70 mm) of MIL-A-12560 armor steel from a distance of 100 yards (91 m). The round struck the plate at a velocity of 2601 fps, and made a complete penetration.
Commercially manufactured rifles chambered in .30-06 are popular for hunting. Current .30-06 factory ammunition varies in bullet weight from 7.1 to 14.3 grams (109.6 to 220.7 gr) in solid bullets, and as low as 3.6 grams (55.6 gr) with the use of a sub-caliber bullet in a sabot. Loads are available with reduced velocity and pressure as well as increased velocity and pressure for stronger firearms. The .30-06 remains one of the most popular sporting cartridges in the world. Many hunting loads have over 3,000 foot-pounds (4,100 J) of energy at the muzzle and use expanding bullets that can deliver rapid energy transfer to targets.
The table above shows typical muzzle velocities available in commercial 30-06 loads along with maximum 30-06 muzzle velocities reported by several reloading manuals for common bullet weights. Hodgdon, Nosler, and Barnes report velocities for 24 inches (610 mm) barrels. Hornady and Speer report velocities for 22 inches (560 mm) barrels. The data are all for barrels with a twist rate of 1 turn in 10 inches (250 mm) which is needed to stabilize the heaviest bullets. The higher muzzle velocities reported by Nosler for 165 grains (10.7 g) and heavier bullets use loads employing a slow-burning, double-base powder (Alliant Reloder 22).
The newer 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester cartridge offers similar performance to standard military .30-06 loadings in a smaller cartridge. However, the greater cartridge capacity of the .30-06 allows much more powerful loadings if the shooter desires.
One reason that the .30-06 has remained a popular round for so long is that the cartridge is at the upper limit of power that is tolerable to most shooters. Recoil energy (Free recoil) greater than 20 foot-pounds force (27 J) will cause most shooters to develop a serious flinch, and the recoil energy of an 8-pound (3.6 kg) rifle firing a 165-grain (10.7 g) 30-06 bullet at 2,900 feet per second (880 m/s) is 20.1 foot-pounds force (27.3 J). Recoil-shy shooters can opt for lighter bullets, such as a 150-grain (9.7 g) bullet. In the same 8-pound (3.6 kg) rifle, a 150-grain (9.7 g) bullet at 2,910 feet per second (890 m/s) will only generate 17.6 foot-pounds force (23.9 J) of recoil energy. Young shooters can start out with even lighter bullets weighing 110, 125 or 130 grains (7.1, 8.1 or 8.4 g).
The .30-06 Springfield cartridge case can hold 68.2 grains (4.42 g) of water and has a volume of 4.42 millilitres (0.270 in3). The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt-action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions.
Americans defined the shoulder angle at alpha/2 = 17.5 degrees. According to the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (C.I.P.) the common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 254 mm (1 in 10 in), 4 grooves, Ø lands = 7.62 mm (.30 in), Ø grooves = 7.82 mm (.308 in), land width = 4.49 mm (.1768 in) and the primer type is large rifle.
According to the official C.I.P. guidelines, the .30-06 Springfield case can handle up to 405 MPa (58,740 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P.-regulated countries, every rifle cartridge combination has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. The 8×64mm S is the closest European ballistic twin of the .30-06 Springfield.
The .30-06 round was replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO round in 1954. However, it did soldier on in the Army Reserves and National Guard for some time; Frankfort Arsenal only stopped production in 1961 and Lake City Army Ammunition Plant was making .30-06 until the late 1970s, with new production batches in 1993 and 2002.
Armor-Piercing, M1917: The M1917 was the first service-issue Armor-Piercing rifle ammunition used by the US Army. It had a steel core in a lead envelope with a partial cupro-nickel jacket which had an exposed soft tip. The exposed tip was designed to aid in the envelope peeling away on impact to allow the core to strike the target. It had the unintended effect of making the thin lead envelope an expanding bullet. Since expanding bullets were seen as violating the Hague Convention it did not see service in World War I.
Armor-Piercing, M1918: The M1918 was similar to the Armor-Piercing M1917 round except it had a smooth cannelure near the case-mouth and had a full-metal-jacketed bullet. It replaced the AP M1917 round in service.
Armor-Piercing, M1922 (1922–1934): This was a redesigned armor-piercing round with a heavier steel core. It was the first Armor-Piercing round to have a black-painted bullet tip.
Armor-Piercing, M1 (1934–1939): This was a higher-velocity (3,180 fps) AP round that was under development throughout its service. It was replaced in 1939 by the AP M2, a redesign of the AP M1922.
Armor Piercing, M2 (1939–1954): This cartridge is used against lightly armored vehicles, protective shelters, and personnel, and can be identified by its black bullet tip. Bullet is flat base, weight 163–168 grains. Defense against the M2 projectile by name is one of the performance standards for Type IV body armor.
Armor Piercing Incendiary, T15/M14 (1943–?) and M14A1 (?–?): This cartridge may be substituted for the M2 armor-piercing round and is normally employed against flammable targets. The tip of the M14 bullet is colored with a blue tip over a black ring. The M14A1 featured an improved core design and incendiary charge. The M14A1 bullet is colored with aluminum paint.
Ball, M1906 (1906–1925): This cartridge is used against personnel and unarmored targets, and can be identified by its silver-colored bullet. The M1906 has a 9.7 g (150-grain) projectile and flat base. Its jacket is a cupro-nickel alloy which was found to quickly foul the bore.
Ball, M1 (1925–1937): The M1 has an 11.2 g (173-grain), nine-degree boat-tailed projectile designed for aerodynamic efficiency. Though it had a lower initial velocity, velocity and energy were greater at longer ranges due to its efficient shape. The harder bullet was made of 7 parts lead to 1 part antimony. The jacket material was changed to gilding metal (an alloy of 95% copper and 5% zinc) to reduce fouling.
Ball, M2 (1937–1954): With a 9.7 g (150-grain) bullet based on the profile of the M1906, this cartridge incorporated the gilding-metal jacket of the M1 projectile combined with a slightly heavier, pure-lead core. It had a higher muzzle velocity than either of the earlier cartridges.
Ball, M2 Alternate (1943–1945): A wartime economy variant of the Ball M2 that used a steel full metal jacket coated with gilding metal to conserve copper and tin.
Blank, M1906: This cartridge is used to simulate rifle fire. It is derived from the M1903 Blank, but with a resized neck. It has a paper bullet that contains a tiny black powder charge to aid in breaking it up.
Blank, M1909: This cartridge is used to simulate rifle fire. The cartridge is identified by having no bullet, having a cannelure in the neck of the case, and the crimp is sealed by red lacquer. This is still a current cartridge for ceremonial M1 Garands. Modern M1909 blanks are rose crimped, but they have the same designation.
Explosive, T99: Development of a cartridge that contained a small explosive charge which more effectively marked its impact. Often referred to as an "observation explosive" cartridge, it was meant to designate line-of-sight targets for cannon. The T99 was never adopted.
Frangible, T44/M22 (April 1945): The bullet disintegrates upon striking a hard or armored target, leaving a pencil-like mark to indicate a hit during bomber aerial gunnery practice. The cartridge is identified by a green bullet tip with a white ring to the rear of the green color.
Gallery Practice M1919: A reduced-charge Ball cartridge with a 140-gr. wax-coated lead round-nosed bullet used for target shooting at indoor facilities or near built-up areas. It was later renamed the Guard M1 in 1933 and was used for guard and sentry duty at defense plants and military installations during World War 2.
Guard M1906 (1907–1918): A reduced-charge Ball cartridge with a 150-gr. FMJ pointed-nose bullet used for guard and sentry duty in built-up areas. The cartridge was originally marked with six cannelures in the middle, but this weakened the case and caused it to burst in a dirty rifle. It was later marked by six dents or flutes on the shoulder of the cartridge. Although production stopped in 1918, there were plenty of stocks of the oddball round left until the 1920s.
High Pressure Test, M1: The cartridge is used to proof test 30-06 rifles and machine guns after manufacture, test, or repair. The cartridge is identified by stannic-stained (silvered) cartridge case.
Incendiary, M1917: Early incendiary cartridge, bullet had a large cavity in the nose to allow the material to more easily shoot forward on impact. As a result, the M1917 had a tendency to expand on impact. The M1917 had a blackened tip.
Incendiary, M1918: Variant of the M1917 with a normal bullet profile to comply with international laws regarding open-tipped expanding bullets.
Tracer, M2: Tracer for observing fire, signaling, target designation, and incendiary purposes. Has a short burn time. The M2 originally had a white tip, but then switched to a red tip like the M1.
Tracer, M2 Alternate (1943–1945): A wartime economy variant of the Tracer M2 that used a steel full metal jacket coated with gilding metal. It was ballistically matched to the Ball M2 Alternate.
Tracer, T10/M25: Improved tracer over M1/M2. Designed to be less intense in terms of brightness than either the M1 or M2 tracers. The M25 had an orange tip.
Rifle Grenade Cartridges, M1 (1933–1945), M2 (1941), M3 (1941–1953), and M3E1 (1953–present): These cartridges are used in conjunction with rifle grenade launchers to propel rifle grenades. The cartridge has no bullet and the mouth is crimped. The differences between the three cartridges have to do with the powder charge and the subsequent range of the launchers. The M1 was a universal Rifle Grenade cartridge that replaced the specialized Rifle Grenade (RG), Chemical Rifle Grenade (CRG), and Chemical Warfare Grenade (CWG) cartridges and was used with cup-discharger rifle grenade launchers. The M2 was an experimental cartridge used as a testbed; it used a propellant mixture of black powder and smokeless powder because it was feared that the smokeless powder would not reliably ignite by itself. The M3 was designed to be used with the M1 series (for the M1903 Springfield rifle), M2 series (for the M1917 Enfield rifle), and M7 series (for the M1 Garand rifle) spigot grenade launchers and used a propellant that was a mixture of a 5-grain amount of FFFG black powder and a 40-grain amount of IMR-4898 smokeless powder. The M3E1 featured an extended case neck, a rosepetal crimp, and a full smokeless powder loading and was designed for use with the M7A3 spigot rifle grenade launcher and larger ENERGA rifle grenade. The Grenade Blanks were issued in double-rowed 10-round cartons, usually as part of a set with the M13 metal Grenade Launcher Assortment ammo can.
The .30-06 (or "Caliber .30") cartridge was adopted in 1940 during the beginnings of the Lend-Lease program in anticipation of using American weapons in front-line service. The British used American-made ammunition during the war, which was designated as Cartridge S.A, .30 to avoid confusing it with their own .303 British service round. It was used after the war as belted machinegun ammunition by the Royal Armored Corps and was not declared obsolete until October, 1993. The "z" after the numeral indicates that it used a nitrocellulose propellant rather than cordite. Marks of ammunition were originally designated with Roman numerals (i.e., .303 Ball Mark VII), but were replaced with Arabic numerals by 1945 (i.e., .303 Ball MK 7).
Cartridge S.A, .30 Ball MK Iz: This was the War Ministry's designation for the 172-grain .30-06 Ball M1 round. It was not accepted for use in service, as the American military had already marked it as limited standard.
Cartridge S.A, .30 Ball MK IIz: This was the War Ministry's designation for the 150-grain .30-06 Ball M2 round. Lend-Lease ammo made for the British government had no mark designation and was headstamped .300z.
Cartridge S.A, .30 Ball MK 3z: This was the designation for an experimental round designed in 1945 for Royal Navy use that was based on the .30-06 Ball M2. It was not adopted for service.
Cartridge S.A, .30 Ball MK 4z: This is a boat-tailed cartridge with a 150-grain Full Metal Jacketed bullet. It is marked with a purple annulus. It was normally packed in 20-round cartons. However, Commonwealth countries that used the M1 Garand (like Pakistan) bundled it in 16-round cartons that contained two preloaded 8-round Mannlicher-style en-bloc clips.
Cartridge S.A, Tracer .30 inch G Mark 1z: This is a boat-tailed cartridge with a 150-grain Full Metal Jacketed bullet and a Berdan primer. It is marked with a red annulus and has a headstamp of .30 G1z.
Cartridge S.A, Tracer .30 inch G Mark 2z: This was made under contract by Fabrique Nationale in the 1970s and is paired with .30 Ball MK 5z. It is the same as the G Mark 1z, except it has a non-corrosive Berdan primer. It is marked with a red bullet tip and has a headstamp of .30 G2z.
Cartridge S.A., Drill Mark II: US Dummy M40 round made by the UK from used US .30-'06 cases. It had a recapped headstamp, Ball or AP bullet over a wooden dowel, and red paint on its flutes.
Cartridge S.A., Drill Mark III: Training cartridge made by the Indian Army. Although described and specified in a 1945 ammunition manual, no copies have been discovered.
The .30-06 round was adopted in 1949 for use in American war surplus military aid weapons like the M1 Garand and M1919 medium machinegun. Military production was from the 1950s to the mid-1960s, while export production to French Union nations lasted until the late 1980s. Cartridge cases were softer than US specifications to prohibit their being recovered and reloaded by insurgents.
7.62mm Modele 1949 Cartouche à Balle Ordinaire: This cartridge was based on the USGI .30-06 Ball M2 (Alternate) round. It had a cupro-nickel- or gilding-metal-clad steel jacket with either a brass or lacquered Parkerized steel case with a Berdan primer.
7.62mm Modele 1951 Cartouche à blanc pour Fusil: This Blank cartridge has a papier-mâché bullet for training use in rifles. The bullet is painted green to tell it apart from regular ammo.
7.62mm Modele 1951 Cartouche à blanc pour Fusil-Mitrailleur: This Blank cartridge has a wooden bullet for training use in machineguns. The bullet is painted or tinted blue to tell it apart from regular ammo.
7.62mm Modele 1952 Cartouche à blanc: This Blank cartridge has a lacquered Parkerized steel case and is sealed by a blue cardboard disc at the case mouth.
Marlin machine gun: Similar to the Colt–Browning machine gun ('Potato Digger'), but without the swinging 'digger' piston (linear gas-action piston replacing the swinging action), and used mainly on aircraft.
Asphalt 7: Heat is a 2012 racing video game, developed and published by Gameloft. It is part of the Asphalt series. It was released on June 21, 2012 for the iOS and marks the first time in the series that a game is the same for both the iPhone and iPad. The game was launched for Android on June 25, for BlackBerry 10 on February 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8 on February 27, for BlackBerry PlayBook on April 3, and for Windows 8 (via Windows Store) on August 22.,Windows 10 on July 29, 2015
Gameplay in Asphalt 7 is very similar to that of previous games in the Asphalt series, with the player given the option of tilting the device, touching the side of the screen, or using an onscreen virtual steering-wheel to steer. The game also has an online multiplayer mode, both local through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and global through an internet connection.
The five star rating system for each race, the use of primary and secondary objectives and the "Adrenaline mode" from Asphalt 6: Adrenaline have all been retained in Asphalt 7.
There are 80 licensed cars available in the game, divided into 7 tiers. The player starts with one car in each tier; the Abarth 500 ESSEESSE (Tier 1), the BMW 1 Series M Coupé (Tier 2), the Dodge Challenger SRT8 (Tier 3), the Cadillac CTS-V Coupé (Tier 4), the Nissan GT-R (Tier 5), the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 (Tier 6) and the Ruf Rt 12 S (Tier 7).
Other cars to become available as the player progresses include, in Tier 1, the Range Rover Evoque, DeLorean DMC-12, Mercedes-Benz Classe C Coupé and Tesla Roadster; in Tier 2, the Plymouth Prowler, Chevrolet Camaro GS, Dodge Charger SRT8 Police and Lotus Exige S; in Tier 3, the Lotus Evora S, BMW M6 Coupé, Alfa Romeo 8C and Lamborghini Sesto Elemento; in Tier 4, the Dodge Viper ACR-X, Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary, Ferrari California and Mazda Furai; in Tier 5, the Cadillac CTS-V Coupé Race Car, Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Spyder Performante, Marussia B2 and Ferrari 575M Maranello; in Tier 6, the McLaren MP4-12C, Ferrari Enzo, Lamborghini Reventón and Aston Martin One-77; and in Tier 7, the Ferrari 288 GTO, Ruf CTR3, McLaren F1 and Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. The fastest car available to the player is the Koenigsegg Agera R (Tier 7)
Asphalt 7 features almost all of the locations from Asphalt 6: Adrenaline, as well as adding new tracks, forming a total of 15 tracks. The locations are New York, Hawaii, Havana, Los Angeles, Nassau, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, Moscow, New Orleans, Reykjavík, London, Alps, Shanghai and Miami.
Upon its release, Asphalt 7 received generally favorable reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 83 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on seventeen reviews, and a score of 80.71% on GameRankings, based on seven reviews.
IGN's George Roush was enthusiastic about the game, awarding a score of 8 out of 10, and concluding "If you're as much of a fan of the Asphalt series as I am then you're going to love Heat. It's nice to see that Gameloft is improving each entry while managing to keep the cost low. Race junkies are going to love looking for shortcuts, catching air and blasting their way through the beautiful looking tracks to the sound of energetic techno music." TouchGen's Dave LeClair was also impressed, scoring the game 4 out of 5; "Overall, this is a great racing game. It has a couple of minor flaws, but nothing gamebreaking. The social sharing hooks after every race can be a little annoying, and they delay the time getting to the next race. Still, slight problems aside, fans of racing games will enjoy the total package offered in Asphalt 7: Heat." Lisa Caplan of 148Apps also scored it 4 out of 5, praising the graphics and controls, although criticizing the gameplay as being very similar to its predecessors; "for the price Asphalt 7 is one of the best arcade racers on iOS. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in polish."
Slide to Play's Nadia Oxford was somewhat less impressed, feeling the game wasn't differentiated enough from the previous games in the series, an argument Andrew Podolsky had made in his review of Asphalt 6 for the site. As with both Asphalt 5 and Asphalt 6, the game was scored 3 out of 4. Oxford wrote "The Asphalt series needs someone to open the windows and let some fresh air in, but it's still impossible to go really go wrong with Asphalt 7: Heat. If you're still happy with Asphalt 6 and you want to save that dollar for ice cream, go ahead and hang onto Adrenaline. You'll live without Heat. But if you don't own an Asphalt game, or if any upgrades to the series makes you happy, regardless of how small those upgrades are, go ahead and grab Asphalt 7: Heat. It's still money well-spent." MacLife's Matt Clark scored the game 3 out of 5, also criticizing its similarity to earlier games in the series, but praising the graphics; "if there's one way that Asphalt 7 improves the series, it's the visual presentation. The vehicles and environments look fantastic on the Retina Display."
Ryan Whitwam of AndroidPolice was less enthused and was heavily critical of several aspects, such as the need to be online for the game to work, the use of real world money and, especially, the graphics; "the deal breaker for me is the overwhelming mediocrity of the graphics. Judging from the screenshots on the Play Store page, this should be a gorgeous game. Instead, it's just average. Even then, only on some devices. On the Nexus 7 the texture resolution is absolutely terrible. Everything in the environment looks muddy. The cars aren't bad, but there is noticeable aliasing along the edges." Wired.com's Ryan Rigney was even more critical, scoring the game 6 out of 10 and criticising the implementation of in-app purchases; "I can't imagine anyone ever spending money on them. Even if you buy the $100 pack of 200 stars, that still won't unlock everything in the game; not by a long shot. So what's the point?" Rigney did however, praise the graphics, arguing that the game has a "polish that would be impressive for an Xbox Live Arcade game. No other arcade racer on the App Store comes close to matching Asphalt 7's presentation quality."
Gensim is a robust open-source vector space modeling and topic modeling toolkit implemented in Python. It uses NumPy, SciPy and optionally Cython for performance. Gensim is specifically designed to handle large text collections, using data streaming and efficient incremental algorithms, which differentiates it from most other scientific software packages that only target batch and in-memory processing.
Gensim includes implementations of tf-idf, random projections, word2vec and document2vec algorithms, hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP), latent semantic analysis (LSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), including distributed parallel versions.
Some of the online algorithms in Gensim were also published in the 2011 PhD dissertation Scalability of Semantic Analysis in Natural Language Processing of Radim Řehůřek, the creator of Gensim.
Gensim has been used and cited in over 500 commercial and academic applications. The software has been covered in several new articles, podcasts and interviews since 2009.
Gensim is commercially supported by the company rare-technologies.com, who also provide student mentorships and academic thesis projects for gensim via their Student Incubator programme.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Guyana (ICAG) is a professional body in Guyana that regulates the accountancy industry and arranges for ongoing training of its members.
Until 1956, accountants in Guyana belonged to the UK-based Association of Certified Corporate Accountants. On 9 November 1966 the Guyana Association of Accountants was incorporated by eight professional accountants. On 11 July 1974 the organization was renamed the Institute of Chartered Accounts of Guyana. The current institute is incorporated under the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Guyana Act 1991, which defines the structure, duties, powers and so on.
The institute is engaged in training and regulation of professional accountants in Guyana. ICAG is a joint examination scheme partner of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). ICAG and ACCA jointly run a practice-monitoring programme, and by the end of 2010 all members had been visited once. ICAG is a member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The institute is also a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean (ICAC). On 25–27 June 2009, ICAG hosted the ICAC 27th Annual Conference of Accountants at the Guyana International Conference Centre.
Harryram Parmessar of the ICAG was appointed president of ICAC for a 2009–2011 term. Speaking in a newspaper interview in August 2009, Parmessar noted the great difficulty of retaining qualified accountants within the country. He said that 25 accountants were trained by the institute each year, but half of them migrated to North America or elsewhere. In a partial effort to address the problem, the government of Guyana now allows any ACCA-qualified Caricom national to practise accountancy in the country, where before only citizens could practise. He noted that discussions on uniform Caribbean company law and Caribbean tax law had never got far, but should be pursued to help make accountants more mobile.
Christopher Carosa (born July 15, 1960) is an American author, journalist, and investment adviser. He is chief contributing editor of FiducaryNews.com, the publisher of the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel, and is a weekly and monthly columnist for ALM's BenefitsPRO, an online news site, and Benefits Selling, a monthly print magazine.
Christopher Carosa was born in Buffalo, New York, at Mercy Hospital, July 15, 1960, the first child of Patsy Dominic Carosa and Lena Butera. His grandparents were native Italians, and played a large role in his approach to business and life. His book, "A Pizza the Action", recounts how his family, both in the home and at their place of business, helped shape his outlook on life, as well as the lesson his grandparents shared about the business world.
Carosa attended elementary schools in the Frontier Central School District in Hamburg, New York, a southern suburb of Buffalo, until the family moved to Chili, New York, a suburb of Rochester. There he attended elementary, junior, and senior high school in the Gates Chili Central School District. While attending high school, he played football, was captain of the Chess Team, and served as concert master of the orchestra. Carosa attended Yale University in 1978–1982, graduating with an B.S. (Intensive) in Physics and Astronomy. During this time, he was the General Manager of the Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey team, being persuaded by then-player and now the team's Head Coach, Keith Allain, and roommate Daniel Poliziani, who eventually became captain of the team and served one year as interim Head Coach of the Bulldogs. Carosa was also a popular disc jockey and sports broadcaster on the college's AM Radio Station. Carosa received an M.B.A. in Finance and Marketing from University of Rochester in 1991.
Chris Carosa's first job out of college was working for Manning & Napier Advisors, Inc. While there, he assisted in the creation of the firm's mutual funds, developed the firm's custodial operations division, and started their affiliated trust company. In 1989, Carosa co-founded the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel with Shirley Arena and severed as co-publisher until he sold his shares to Arena in mid-1990s. Using the proceeds of that sale, he left Manning & Napier to start Carosa, Stanton Asset Management LLC, a SEC Registered Investment Adviser, where he continues to serve as President. In 1997, he created Bullfinch Fund, Inc., a family of no-load flexible mutual funds, where he continues to serve as Chairman of the Board, President, and Portfolio Manager, and in 2000, Carosa created Independent Fiduciary Consultants, a division of Carosa, Stanton Asset Management LLC the serves 401(k) plan sponsors. Carosa started FiduciaryNews.com, an online trade journal/news site, in September 2009, where he continues to serve as Chief Contributing Editor. In December 2015, Carosa reprised his role as publisher of the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel when his wife's publishing company, Pandamensional Solutions, Inc., acquired the paper.
An epic is traditionally a genre of poetry, known as epic poetry. In modern terms, epic is often extended to describing other art forms, such as epic theatre, films, music, novels, television series, and video games, wherein the story has a theme of grandeur and heroism, just as in epic poetry. Scholars argue that the epic has long since become "disembedded" from its origins in oral poetry, appearing in successive narrative media throughout history.
There are many genres of epic (exclusive of epic poetry): epic fantasy describes works of fantasy, such as in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Epic fantasy has been described as containing three elements: it must be a trilogy or longer, its time-span must encompass years or more, and it must contain a large back-story or universe setting in which the story takes place. Epic fantasy is not limited to the Western tradition: for example, Arabic epic literature includes One Thousand and One Nights; and Indian epic poetry includes Ramayana and Mahabharata.
The epic film genre encompasses historical epics, religious epics, and western epics, although it has split into many other genres and subgenres.
The female epic examined ways in which female authors have adapted the masculine epic tradition to express their own heroic visions. There are chivalric epics from the Middle Ages, national epics, and pan-national epics. The real-life stories of heroic figures have also been referred to as being epic; examples include Ernest Shackleton's exploration adventures in Antarctica.
Roodeschool (Gronings: Roschoul) is a community situated in the northeast of Groningen province in the Netherlands and forming part of the municipality of Eemsmond. It had a population of around 860 in January 2017.
The name, which means "red school", is derived from the local noteworthiness of the red roof tiles of a village school which once stood in the vicinity.
Fort Sill National Cemetery is a United States National Cemetery located in the city of Elgin in Comanche County, Oklahoma. Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, it encompasses 391.3 acres (158.4 ha), and as of 2014 had more than 4,000 interments.
Fort Sill was established in 1869, in what was then Indian territory, by Major General Philip H. Sheridan, and named in honor of Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill, who died at the Battle of Stones River. The area around Fort Sill served as a reservation for displaced Native American groups. Apache Chief Geronimo lived the last days of his life, and died at Fort Sill, as did Kiowa Chief Kicking Bird.
Fort Sill National Cemetery was dedicated on November 2, 2001, it was the second National Cemetery built in the state of Oklahoma. The first stage of development of the cemetery finished in 2003. It is an expansion to the small burial area originally at Fort Sill.
Gurkhas were ruling in Nepal. From 1767 onwards, they extended their power over the hills and valleys of Nepal. They were ruling on Feudal basis and soon became powerful. They marched into the Kumaun and Gangetic Plains and raided in the British Territories.
The British had recently acquired the lands of Nawab of Oudh and Gorakhpur, Sikkim were on the front. The dispute was because of no fixed boundary. The war ended in a defeat of Gurkhas. The British army marched from Patna to Kathmandu and finally dictated the terms of Treaty of Sugauli, which defined the English relations with Nepal.
Gurkhas lost control over Sikkim, the territories of Kumaon and Garhwal, and most of the lands of the Terai; the British East India Company promised to pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Terai region.
King Prithvi Narayan Shah (1723–75) of the Shah dynasty decided to enlarge the kingdom that was confined to the small Gorkha region of Nepal and had an area of just 2,500 square kilometres (970 sq mi). He defeated major principalities in wars and unified them under his rule starting from the 1740s ending with shifting of his Gorkha Kingdom’s capital from Gorkha region to Kathmandu in 1769. He then attacked and absorbed dozens of other small principalities of Nepal area to his Gorkha kingdom. After his death in 1775, his eldest son Pratap Singh Shah continued defeating other smaller princes and absorbing their fiefdoms. Pratap Shah died at the age of twenty-five in 1777. Then Prithvi Narayan Shah’s second son, Bahadur Shah, ruled until 1794.
The Gorkha army invaded Kumaon Kingdom and occupied it in 1790–91. Then the Gorkha army invaded Garhwal Kingdom and occupied it in 1804 after defeating its King Pradyuman Shah. In 1806, the Gorkha army absorbed all the small kingdoms like Sirmudh state, Hindur and Besahar lying across the Garhwal and up to Satluj River. In this way, the Gorkhas controlled the hilly regions such as Nainital, Almora and Dehradun without crossing the Satluj River. However, when the Gorkhas crossed the Satluj river, the Gorkha's attack on Kangra and siege of Kangra Fort west of Satluj river was repulsed by the Kangra king with help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab in 1809. Later the Gorkha army absorbed Kangra and extended the kingdom to Ravi river, India. This could not last long as Nepal signed Sugauli treaty.
Previously Darjeeling formed a part of dominions of the Raja of Sikkim, who had been engaged in an unsuccessful warfare against the Gorkhas. From 1780 the Gorkhas continually made inroads into Sikkim. Sikkim lost most of its land to Nepal and by the beginning of the 19th century, the Gorkhas had overrun Sikkim as far-eastward as the Teesta and had conquered and annexed the Terai.
Nepal had conflict with its northern neighbors with Tibet and China over trade dispute and it's government had renounced all claims of influence in Tibet and maintained a policy of non-intervention in its affairs whereas Nepal fought war with East India Company over border dispute.
During the Sino-Nepalese War, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse. Alarmed, the Qianlong Emperor of the Chinese Qing Dynasty appointed Fuk'anggan commander-in-chief of the Tibetan campaign; Fuk'anggan signed treaty to protect his troops thus attaining a draw.
Later Nepalese–Tibetan War was fought from 1855 to 1856 in Tibet between the forces of the Tibetan government (Ganden Phodrang, then under administrative rule of the Qing dynasty) and the invading Nepalese army resulting victory of Nepal.
The Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16) was fought between the Kingdom of Gorkha (present-day Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal) and the East India Company as a result of border disputes and ambitious expansionism of both the belligerent parties. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, which ceded around a third of Nepal's territory to the British.
The British were the invading forces, while the Nepalese maintained a defensive position. The British attacked in two successive waves of invasion. It was the most expensive war waged during the governorship of Lord Moira.
The East India Company had come to rule much of north India by the time the Gurkhas attacked kingdoms in South Asia. The Company became the de facto ruler of South Asia east of Satluj river in place of the Moghuls, Marathas and other kings, especially after defeating the Marathas in 1803 in Second Anglo-Maratha War. After firmly establishing its rule over Delhi in 1803, the Company attacked the Gorkhas and repulsed them from Kumaon Kingdom and Garhwal Kingdom in the area west of Kali river and in Sikkim and north Bengal east of Teesta river by 1815. The Gorkhas were forced to accept a peace treaty with the British (the Sugauli Treaty) in 1816.
There is not any official claim by Government of Nepal or any political party of Nepal to take back the ceded territory to British East India Company by Nepal which is now territory of Republic of India.
Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairperson of Maoist party, who spent 10 years of his life in India after being declared a terrorist by the Nepalese government, after becoming PM of Nepal said in an interview with Times of India in 2005 that Greater Nepal was a "media-created stunt".
Xihe County (Chinese: 西和县; Pinyin: Xīhé Xiàn) is a county under charge of Longnan City, Gansu Province of China. It has a land area of abcd square kilometers, and a population of P0,0000 in 2008. The postal code is 742500. The county seat is located in the town of Hanyuan (汉源镇).

Radio Corporation of the Philippines is the oldest radio network in the Philippines, currently owned by Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. through his company Lucky Star Holdings.
KZKZ (AM) is the second radio station in the Philippines owned by Henry Herman Sr. in 1922. It broadcast using a 5-watt transmitter. In 1924, it boosted its power to 100 watts. A few months later, Radio Corporation of the Philippines bought KZKZ AM from Henry Hermann. In 1926 the company began to work on constructing two of the largest radio stations in Asia with the idea of maintaining direct Manila-San Francisco service. After Philippine independence, it changed its callsign to DWKZ, but changed in 1960 to DZCA.
In 1929, RCP launched KZRC in Cebu broadcasting with a 100-watt transmitter, but was later sold to store owner Isaac Beck (it is now DYRC owned by the Manila Broadcasting Company). However, in 1970, RCP launched DYRB.
In 2015, RadioCorp officially ventured into television broadcasting with the launch of the network's first television station DZPT-TV 26 on January 15. RCP TV 26 is currently affiliated with CNN Philippines and Radio Philippines Network.
The RadioCorp group is composed of 5 broadcast companies: the RadioCorp itself, Philippine Radio Corporation (PhilRadio), Radio Audience Developers Integrated Organization Inc. (RADIO Inc.), Beacon Communications Systems Inc. (BCSI) and Radyo Pilipino Corporation (Radyo Pilipino), It also produced the weekly business show Asenso Pinoy aired every Saturdays at 9:00 am on S+A Channel 23.
Dadagiri is an Indian reality show that premiered on Bindass in 2008. The title of the show was derived from a word commonly used by the Gujarati community.
In its first season, called Dadagiri: Beat the Bullies premiered in 2008, contestants were selected every week and would compete for a prize money of Rs. 50,000. It was hosted Akash and had 3 "bull": Vishal as "The Beast", Srman as "The Mindstein", and Esha as "The Goddess"and Quaiser Jamal as a juicy the chef
The second season premiered in 2009 and featured 12 contenders competing for a prize of Rs. 1,000,000. It became the highest-rated program among Indian youth TV channels in that year. It had 2 bullies; Vishal returned as "The Beast" for the second season, and Sonalli Sehgall replaced Esha as "The Goddess".
The fourth and final season premiered in 2011, titled Dadagiri: The Revenge of the Sexes, featured two groups divided by gender. The male team was led by Vishal as "The Beast" and the female team by Shaurya as "The Goddess".
The show is mostly scripted but with an improvisational style. Actors and hosts are supposed to bully one another, but violence was never agreed upon.
In one episode, "Esha, the Goddess" (Esha Bhaskar) slapped a contestant named Ravi Bhatia in an unscripted physical attack. He immediately slapped her back.
The incident resulted in the male host (Akash Beri) and several other members of the crew physically assaulting Bhatia while he repeatedly asked "How can she slap [me]?" [sic] with the crew appearing to be slow in breaking them up.
Threats of violence were later made against Bhatia's sister and mother} by the host Akash Beri and crew. Bhatia subsequently sent a legal notice to the producers, asking for a public apology.

The Intermediate System to Intermediate System protocol (IS-IS), is defined in the IETF proposed standard RFC 6329, is used as the control plane for IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB). SPB requires no state machine or other substantive changes to IS-IS, and simply requires a new Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID) and set of TLVs.
SPB allows for shortest-path forwarding in an Ethernet mesh network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths. This permits SPB to support large Layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh topology. Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership. IS-IS is therefore augmented with a small number of TLVs and sub-TLVs, and supports two Ethernet encapsulating data paths, 802.1ad Provider Bridges (PB) and 802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB).
SPB is designed to run in parallel with other network layer protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6. Standards mandate that the failure of two nodes to establish an SPB adjacency will not have collateral impact, such as the rejection of an adjacency for other network layer protocols (e.g. OSPF).
802.1aq has been designed to operate in parallel with other network layer protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6; therefore, failure of two nodes to establish an SPB adjacency will not cause network layer protocols to also reject an adjacency. 802.1aq has been assigned the Network Layer Protocol ID (NLPID) value 0xC1, as per RFC 6328, and is used by SPB Bridges to indicate their ability to form adjacencies and operate as part of a 802.1aq domain. 802.1aq frames flow on adjacencies that advertise this NLPID in both directions, and nodes regard an adjacency that has not advertised in both directions as non-existent (infinite link metric). 802.1aq augments the normal IIH PDU with three new TLVs, which like all other SPB TLVs, travel within Multi-Topology TLVs, therefore allowing multiple logical instances of SPB within a single IS-IS protocol instance.
SPB can use many VIDs, agreeing on which VIDs are used for which purposes. The IIH PDUs carry a digest of all the used VIDs, referred to as the Multiple Spanning Tree Configuration TLV which uses a common and compact encoding reused from 802.1Q.
For the purposes of loop prevention SPB neighbors may also support a mechanism to verify that the contents of their topology databases are synchronized. Exchanging digests of SPB topology information, using the optional SPB-Digest sub-TLV, allows nodes to compare information and take specific action where a mismatch in topology is indicated.
Finally, SPB needs to know which Shortest Path Tree (SPT) sets are being used by which VIDs, and this is carried in the Base VLAN Identifiers TLV.
All SPB nodal information extensions travel within a new Multi-Topology (MT) capability TLV. There can be one or many MT-Capability TLVs present, depending on the amount of information that needs to be carried.
The SPB Instance sub-TLV gives the Shortest Path Source ID (SPSourceID) for this node/topology instance. This used in the formation of Multicast Destination Addresses (DAs) for frames originating from this node/instance.
There are multiple ECT algorithms defined for SPB; however, for the future, additional algorithms may be defined, including but not limited to ECMP- or hash-based behaviors and (*,G) Multicast trees. These algorithms will use this optional TLV to define new algorithm parametric data. For tie-breaking parameters, there are two broad classes of algorithm, one that uses nodal data to break ties and one that uses link data to break ties. The SPB Instance Opaque Equal cost Tree Algorithm TLV is used to associate opaque tie-breaking data with a node.
The SPB Link Metric sub-TLV occurs within the Multi-Topology Intermediate System Neighbor TLV or within the Extended IS Reachability TLV. Where this sub-TLV is not present for an IS-IS adjacency, then that adjacency will not carry SPB traffic for the given topology instance.
There are multiple ECT algorithms defined for SPB; however, for the future, additional algorithms may be defined; similarly the SPB Adjacency Opaque Equal Cost Tree Algorithm TLV also occurs within the Multi-Topology Intermediate System TLV or the Extended IS Reachability TLV.
The SPBM Service Identifier and Unicast Address TLV is used to introduce service group membership on the originating node and/or to advertise an additional B-MAC Unicast Address present on, or reachable by the node. The SPBV MAC Address TLV is the IS-IS sub-TLV used for advertisement of Group MAC Addresses in SPBV mode.
Scott Rettich (born September 7, 1984 in Dayton, Ohio) is an American racing driver currently competing in the 2013 U.S. F2000 National Championship season in the National class.
Scott Rettich started karting in 1996. Between 1998 and 2004 Scott Rettich entered the Ohio Valley Karting Club championship collecting 5 titles in various classes.

Synodontis macrostigma, known as the largespot squeaker, is a species of upside-down catfish that is native to Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia where it is found in the Cunene, Okavango, upper Zambezi and Kafue River systems. It was first described by British-Belgian zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1911, from specimens collected in the Okovango River, Botswana, by R. B. Woosnam. The species name macrostigma is derived from the Greek word makros, meaning "large", and the Greek word stigma, meaning "mark" or "spot" and refers to the large spots on the sides of the fish.
Like all members of the Synodontis genus, S. macrostigma has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. macrostigma, the humeral process is a little longer than it is broad, triangular in shape, rough, and without a ridge on the lower edge.
The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is long and straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base. It extends to a length of about ​4⁄5 times the length of the head. The outer pair of mandibular barbels is a little under twice the length of the inner pair, and both pairs have short branches.
The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines. In S. macrostigma, the spine of the dorsal fin is about as long as the head, slightly curved, smooth in the front and serrated on the back. The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays. The spine of the pectoral fin is shorter than the size of the dorsal spine, and serrated on both sides. The adipose fin is 4 to ​4 1⁄2 times as long as it is deep. The anal fin contains four unbranched and eight branched rays. The tail, or caudal fin, is deeply forked.
All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In S. macrostigma, the toothpad forms a short and broad band. On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as "s-shaped" or "hooked". The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. macrostigma, there are about 20 to 26 teeth on the mandible.
The base body color is brown on the top surface, becoming lighter toward the underside. The back and sides have large round or oval blackish spots, smaller spots appear on the head and fins.
The maximum total length of the species is 17.1 centimetres (6.7 in). Generally, females in the Synodontis genus tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.
In the wild, the species has been found in the upper Zambezi River basin, and the Okavango River system. The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females. Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning. As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes. The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.
Lewis P. Dayton (1821–1900) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1874–1875. He was born at Eden, New York on the family farm in 1821. He studied medicine in the office of Dr. Timothy T. Lockwood and moved to Buffalo. He graduated in 1846 from the Geneva Medical College, in Geneva, New York. He returned to Buffalo as a physician in the Black Rock section. Around 1846 he married Grace Webster Holley, who died at a young age. Dayton first remarried Mrs. Alice Maud Hayes, who died about a year after their marriage, then in 1892, he married Margaret Vogt.
He was first elected an alderman from the 12th Ward in 1855. He was Erie County Clerk from 1865 to 1867. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Erie Co., 3rd D.) in 1868. In 1868, Dayton was appointed to the first Board of Park Commissioners and was chosen health physician for the City in 1871. On November 4, 1873, Dayton was elected mayor as the Democratic candidate. He did not seek a second term and retired to his private medical practice. He died on May 14, 1900, and was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery His brain was preserved in alcohol, possibly for medical research.
The Dayton House that Lewis P. Dayton lived in while residing in Black Rock, is located at 243 Dearborn Street. This home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.
Ivan the Terrible ([Иван Грозный] ), Op. 116, is the score composed by Sergei Prokofiev in 1942–45 for Sergei Eisenstein's film Ivan the Terrible and its sequel, the first two parts of an incomplete trilogy. The project was Prokofiev's second collaboration with Eisenstein, the first being the popular Aleksandr Nevskiy (1938). The majority of the song texts were written by Vladimir Lugovskoy, who collaborated with Prokofiev on the texts for Aleksandr Nevskiy.
The subject of the "First Tale" (Part 1) is the early years, 1547 to 1565, of the reign of Ivan IV of Russia: his coronation, his intent to curb the powers of the boyars, his wedding, his conquest of Kazan, his almost fatal illness, the poisoning and death of his first wife Anastasiya, the formation of the Oprichniki, and his abdication.
The "Second Tale" (Part 2), subtitled The Boyar Conspiracy, covers the years 1565 to 1569, and concerns the defection of Prince Kurbskiy to Poland-Lithuania, Ivan's disputes with Philip II, Metropolitan of Moscow, the intrigues of the boyars, the excesses of the Oprichniki, the attempted coup by the boyars and Ivan's aunt, Yefrosinya Staritskaya, the murder of her son Vladimir Staritsky, and Ivan's triumph over his domestic enemies.
The film scores were not published during Prokofiev's lifetime. They were arranged in 1961 as an oratorio for soloists, chorus, and orchestra by Levon Atovmyan, one of Prokofiev's assistants. However, before this version could be performed, the music received its concert premiere in 1961 in Moscow in the form of an oratorio for speaker, soloists, chorus, and orchestra by Abram Stasevich, who conducted the scores for Eisenstein.
In 1973 the composer Mikhail Chulaki and choreographer Yuri Grigorovich drew on Prokofiev's film scores to create the ballet Ivan the Terrible, which was given its premiere in 1975. Later performing editions of the scores include an oratorio put together by Michael Lankester (1989), and a concert scenario by Christopher Palmer (1991). The restoration of the entire original film score has been published and recorded.
1958, 'Songs and Choruses from the Music for the Film Ivan the Terrible', vocal scores, published by Levon Atovmyan in the magazine Sovetskaya Muzyka; the six numbers included: 'The Black Cloud', 'Ocean-Sea', 'Song of Praise', 'The Swan', 'The Cannoneers', and 'Song about the Beaver'
1960, 'Songs and Choruses from Cantatas, Oratorios, and Films', published by Levon Atovmyan, vocal scores, Sovetskiy Kompozitor; the numbers from Ivan the Terrible included 'The Oath of the Oprichniki', 'Song of Fyodor Basmanov and the Oprichniki', and the 'Song of the Oprichniki'
Note: The column marked 'S' shows the numbering of the musical numbers by Musikverlage Hans Sikorski, the publisher of the restored film score (zeros have been inserted before single digit numbers for sorting purposes). 'A' stands for Anhang (the appendix), which includes the liturgical numbers used in the film that were either arranged by Prokofiev or were not written into his score of Ivan the Terrible.
The table can be sorted by clicking on the buttons in the title bar. The default sequence can be restored by refreshing the browser (press F5).
The first part of 'The Death of Glinskaya' accompanies, in the second film, the flashback of the poisoning of the 8-year-old-Ivan's mother; the second part is the chorus 'On the Bones of our Enemies'.
The first half of 'Come Back!' depicts the people's chorus of supplication after Ivan's abdication; the second half is the 'Finale' (a variation of 'A Storm Approaches'), which concludes both films.
Atovmyan's oratorio finally received its public premiere on 28 January 2012 at the Royal Festival Hall, London. Vladimir Jurowski conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. The soloists were Ewa Podleś and Andrey Breus.
The Russian premiere took place on 2 April 2012 in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. Vladimir Jurowski conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra with the Sveshnikov State Academic Russian Choir and the Chamber Choir of the Moscow Conservatory. The soloists were Elena Zaremba and Andrey Breus.
The North American premiere took place on 18 October 2012 at Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco. Vladimir Jurowski conducted the San Francisco Symphony and Chorus. The soloists were Elena Zaremba and Andrey Breus.
Atovmyan's oratorio is in 8 sections, some consisting of several numbers (or parts of numbers) from the film score—refer to 'Sequence' below:
Woodwinds: 2 piccolos, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, english horn, 2 clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, tenor saxophone, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon
"Without adding material of his own or making changes to the composer's manuscript, A. Stasevich approached the music for the film in a creative manner turning it into an oratorio consisting of 20 numbers. By repeating certain episodes and sections, and by linking them in a variety of ways, Stasevich was able to turn the various parts of this substantial work into self-contained numbers. In order to comply with the dictates of musical logic, he did not always adhere strictly to the order of the musical episodes prescribed by the plot. Thus certain episodes were transformed into tripartite structures, and others expanded to become rather large movements. Certain changes were also made to the orchestration, and certain instrumental lines were reinforced ... Stasevich also added another formal determinant in the shape of a speaker."
The premiere took place on 23 April 1961 in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. Abram Stasevich conducted the Moscow State Philharmonic Orchestra.
Stasevich's oratorio is in 20 movements, some consisting of several numbers (or parts of numbers) from the film score—refer to 'Sequence' below:
The ballet Ivan the Terrible was arranged by Mikhail Chulaki for a 1975 production by choreographer Yuriy Grigorovich at the Bolshoy Theatre. The two act work consists of selections from Prokofiev's film score for Ivan the Terrible supplemented with excerpts from his Symphony No. 3 (1928), Russian Overture (1936), and film score for Aleksandr Nevsky (1938).
The world premiere performance took place on 20 February 1975 at the Bolshoy Theatre. Algis Zhuraitis conducted. The cast included Yuriy Vladimirov (Ivan), Nataliya Bessmertnova (Anastasiya), and Boris Akimov (Kurbskiy).
Christopher Palmer discusses his Ivan the Terrible concert scenario in the notes to a Chandos CD recording made a few days after the work's premiere:
"...in 1962 Abram Stasevich (1906-1971), who had conducted Ivan for the film soundtrack, published his Ivan the Terrible 'oratorio' for speaker, soloists, chorus and orchestra which incorporated all the major musical sequences in the film plus a few that had been left out (notably 'Russian Sea'). It is in this form that the Ivan music has been known outside the film ever since, and in this form that critics have tended to find it long and diffuse. The main problem is the speaker, introduced by Stasevich primarily because he had been unwise enough to try and incorporate a large number of short fragmentary episodes, and had to find a way of stitching them together. Unfortunately once the speaker was in, he seemed to take over the entire work—much to its detriment in terms of narrative intelligibility and tightness of structure. My new 'performing version' eliminates the speaker and shorter sections (most of which are pastiche Russian-liturgical music of minimal Prokofievian interest). It also restores a number of episodes to their original format, most importantly the assassination of the Pretender in Part II—the climax of the film and one of the most electrifying moments in film music. While retaining Stasevich's make-up of most of the larger movements, I have reverted largely to the film's original sequence of musical events."
The concert scenario received its premiere on 28 February 1991 at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Neeme Järvi conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus.

Code Name: Jackal (Hangul: 자칼이 온다; lit. "The Jackal Is Coming" or "Here Comes the Jackal") is a 2012 South Korean action comedy film, starring Song Ji-hyo, Kim Jae-joong of JYJ, and Oh Dal-su. The film was directed by Bae Hyoung-jun, whose works included Too Beautiful to Lie and Once Upon a Time. It was produced by Nomad Films and distributed by Lotte Entertainment. It was released on 15 November 2012 and ran for 105 minutes.
Clumsy and off-the-wall hit man Bong Min-jung (Song Ji-hyo) is hired to kill top Hallyu star Choi Hyun (Kim Jae-joong). The mission starts by abducting him at Paradise Hotel in Seong-ju, the place where Hyun checked in to rest and stay away from stress, and also where the cops are on a stakeout for serial killer "Jackal". Later on, Hyun finds out that the person who hired Min-jung to kill him is his ex-girlfriend. He then tries to convince Min-jung that he isn't the 'top Hallyu star Choi Hyun' she is looking for so that she would let him escape, one by purposely singing out of tune. Conversations and several attempts to escape happens, until a fan of Hyun (the same one who sneaked into his car at the beginning of the story which caused him to switch cars with his manager) follows him to the hotel and goes inside his room through the window. The girl unties the ropes and takes him to her own suite. Hope vanishes, however, as the girl starts torturing him. Min-jung on the other hand arrived and saved him by using a stun gun on the sasaeng fan. Angela arrives later on and meets Hyun, who is a boy toy of hers, but is stabbed to death during her encounter with Min-jung.
"Jackal" arrives after and starts assaulting Hyun until he and Min-jung reaches the rooftop. Min-jung says that she loves hearing the words "I'll protect you" from Hyun, forcefully kissing him. Min-jung kicks him after, making him to fall down a roof nearby and lose consciousness. "Jackal" reaches the rooftop and engages on a fight against Min-jung, and the truth unravels—Min-jung is the true "Jackal" and the man behind the killing spree is only using her alias. It was also revealed that Min-jung's real target is Angela, and that Choi Hyun is only used as a bait for "Jackal". Flashback also shows that his ex-girlfriend doesn't want Hyun to die, but only wants him to experience betrayal. Min-jung sprays some sort of chemical towards her face to make herself faint and avoid suspicion.
The scene after shows Min-jung talking to Angela's husband Kim Yong-gun, who was actually the one who hired her, telling him that she died instantly despite of the instruction to kill her slowly, showing a flashback on how she managed to stab her. She then leaves the place after getting the salary.
The story ends with Min-jung booking a flight to Buenos Aires to start a new life. While she's waiting for the plane, Hyun calls and asks her to work with him, and after telling him to deposit money, he threatens her by saying he could expose the secret, having Min-jung tell him: "Just wait, I'll kill you".
The film marks the first collaboration between Kim and Song, as well as Kim's first starring role in a big screen debut. A press conference was attended by the cast: Kim Jae-joong, Song Ji-hyo, Han Sang-jin and Oh Dal-su, held on 9 November 2012 at the Lotte Cinema at Konkuk University.
The film ranked fourth and grossed ₩966,147,307 on its first week of release, and grossed a total of ₩1,351,848,104 domestically after two weeks of screening.
Ahead of the film's release, it was announced by its distributor Lotte Entertainment that the film has been pre-sold to six Asian countries: Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,Indonesia and Brunei.

The Seven Sisters Oak is the largest certified southern live oak tree. Located in Mandeville, Louisiana, it is estimated to be up to 1,500 years old with a trunk that measures 467 inches (38.9 ft; 11.9 m) in circumference, with a height of 68 feet and crown spread of 139 feet. This oak is also the National Champion on the National Register of Big Trees and the Champion Oak of Louisiana, according to the Louisiana Forestry Association. The owner who first named the tree was Carole Hendry Doby, who was one of seven sisters. There are seven sets of branches leading away from the center trunk. The Seven Sisters survived a near direct hit from Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.
The "Seven Sisters Oak," formerly known as "Doby's Seven Sisters," is the current president of the Live Oak Society, a status awarded to it by being the largest live oak registered by the society.
The Sutherlands of Forse were a minor Scottish noble family. Kenneth Sutherland, 1st of Forse was the second son of William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland. They were a cadet branch of the Clan Sutherland.
The Sutherland Lairds of Forse were seated at Forse Castle in the hamlet of Forss on the north coast of the county of Caithness. They lived there until about the year 1660. They later built a mansion house about a mile inland. This was demolished and replaced with a greater mansion house called "Forse House" which the Lairds of Forse occupied until 1905 and has since been used as a hotel and nursing home.
In the early 16th century the Earldom of Sutherland passed through a female heiress to the Gordon family. Later, during the late 16th century the Sutherland Lairds of Forse supported the Earl of Caithness in a feud against the Gordon family who had taken over as Earls of Sutherland, and Nicolas Sutherland, brother of the Laird of Forse was killed at the Battle of Clynetradwell in 1590.
Upon the death of William Gordon, 18th Earl of Sutherland in 1766, George Sutherland of Forse made a claim for the Earldom, based on his descent from William, 5th Earl of Sutherland who died in 1370. However, the House of Lords found the case in favour of Elizabeth, only surviving daughter of the 18th Earl. The last Sutherland Laird of Forse in the direct line died in 1909, leaving two daughters but no son.
Bijga is a place in Tunisia, North Africa, near the city of Tunis. During the Roman Empire it was known as Bisca and was a Civitas (town) of the Roman province of Africa. The town was also the seat of an ancient Christian bishopric, which although ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, survives today as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church The ruins of the ancient town can still be seen.
One of the best sources for the world of European Renaissance Humanism in the early 16th century is the correspondence of Erasmus. Among those with whom he exchanged letters are:
Toxgnostics is part of Personalized medicine as it describes the guiding principles for the discovery of pharmacogenomic biomarker tests, also referred to as companion diagnostic tests, which identify if an individual patient is likely to suffer severe drug toxicity from treatment with a specific therapeutic agent. Once at risk individuals are identified drug toxicity can be prevented using elective dose reduction or prescription of an alternative medication.
The majority of toxgnostic studies have been candidate gene studies restricted to the known Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion genes (ADME) of drug treated patients. The PharmaADME consortium identified 32 core genes containing 184 variants within common pathways that should be included in ADME candidate gene studies of toxicity biomarkers. Toxicity biomarkers that have been clinically validated using this restricted panel of genes include the P450 cytochrome assay that is currently recommended for routine clinical use of the oral anticoagulant warfarin. Using next-generation sequencing methods and genome-wide association studies a more comprehensive toxgnostic approach can be utilized through unbiased analysis of several million variants across the whole human genome, including introns and exons, for pharmacogenomic markers of drug induced toxicity.
Cancer drugs have been highlighted as particularly appropriate candidates for toxgnostic studies due to the significant toxicity profiles associated with both targeted therapies and chemotherapy. Most cancer patients obtain only modest benefit from treatment, whereas toxicity is common and often associated with severe side effects which include considerable morbidity and mortality. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil (5FU) prescribed as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection of early stage colorectal cancer benefits only approx. 4% of patients, whereas 30–40% of those treated will suffer severe toxicity such as neutropenia, mucositis, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, and stomatitis, fatal toxicities will kill 0.5-1% of people treated. Through the use of toxgnostic screens a number of genetic variants have now been identified that can be used to predict 5FU toxicity prior to treatment. These genetic variants can be used to identify the individuals predisposed to severe drug toxicity and the dose of 5FU chemotherapy can be reduced to prevent severe toxic side effects. Toxgnostic biomarker tests currently available for use in clinical practice include markers for irinotecan, thioguanine, warfarin and 5FU.
The phenotype of interest should be clinically relevant and clearly defined using internationally standardized criteria and systematically captured such as the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3–5 toxicity.
Analysis should be unbiased to encompass the maximum relevant genomic diversity, rather than being limited by what is often a superficial understanding of the pathways involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the agent.
The performance of individual variants should be compared with that of a combined risk score, which may outperform each individual variant when they are analysed separately.
Appropriate analytical approaches for toxgnostic studies include candidate gene studies, GWAS and whole genome sequencing. GWAS and whole genome sequencing are the most comprehensive approaches though careful considerations must be applied to the relevance, analysis and interpretation of the results to prevent over-fitting, which produces false-positive results, a proposed GWAS workflow is shown below.
Toxicity biomarkers can be co-developed and co-approved with the respective drug as a companion diagnostic test, this requires premarket approval (PMA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IVD Companion Diagnostic Device guidance issued in draft 14 July 2011 states that a companion diagnostic test can be used to “Identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product”. Additionally there are guidleines for the submission of pharmacogenomic studies from the FDA and draft guidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
This Crazy Life is the debut studio album by American singer Joanna Pacitti, more commonly known as Joanna. The singles from this album are "Let It Slide" and "Screaming Infidelities". One of Pacitti's songs, "Ultraviolet" was featured on the Girl Next compilation album. It was also covered by the Stiff Dylans for the movie soundtrack of Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. One of the songs from the album "Just When You're Leaving" was included on the album "Chelsea Mix" which was released to promote the My Scene dolls.
Spokane Civic Theatre is a nationally recognized non-profit theatre located in Spokane, Washington. Incorporated in 1947, the theatre is one of the oldest community theatres in the country. In recent years, the theatre has been brought to a level of excellence that has resulted in many awards. The theatre's mission is "to foster and operate a volunteer live community theatre of high artistic merit." Civic, as it is fondly called by the surrounding community, sets a high standard for theatre in the Spokane area.
Spokane Civic Theatre is one of few community theatres that owns its own building and land. The present facility houses two performance spaces: The Main Stage Theatre and The Firth J. Chew Studio Theatre. The Main Stage auditorium is a proscenium theatre with a seating capacity of 336, while the Studio theatre is a small, black box theatre seating approximately 85. The seating in the Studio theatre can be moved, which allows specific productions to fill the space in a new way, like the 2011 production of Metamorphoses, which housed a pool. Both stages are wheel-chair accessible, and the Main Stage also provides Sennhiser infra-red assistive listening devices and a Hearing Loop system (installed in 2014) for patrons with hearing disabilities. The backstage area houses a scene shop, sewing room, storage for props, a fully furnished green room, offices and dressing rooms. Children under the age of five, including infants, are not allowed into performances as a courtesy to other patrons.
As one of the oldest community theatres in the country, Spokane Civic Theatre is a point of pride for the city. Incorporated in 1947, performances were held in other facilities at first, including the old Post Theater and, beginning in 1957, the Riverside Playhouse. The present facility was opened in 1967. In 1972, a three story addition was made, adjoining to the backstage area of the main theatre. This space was used for set construction, rehearsals, the costume shop, and offices for the continued upkeep of the theatre. The lower levels of the theatre, previously used as rehearsal space, were converted into a studio theatre in 1979. It was named for long-time volunteer Firth J. Chew in 1989. Currently, it is used as a black box theatre, and many of the smaller or experimental productions take place there. In 2013, the Main Stage Women's restroom was expanded and a new Donor Lounge & Meeting Room was added onto the building.
In addition, Civic used to be home to the Box and Hat Players, a performance troupe devoted to spreading a love of musical theatre to community members of all ages. Spokane Children's Theatre also used Civic's stage at one time.
Civic serves as a resource for local high school and college theatre departments. It also operates a theatre school - The Academy - for all ages. Civic provides a variety of workshops in acting, directing, voice, dance, stage combat and technical theatre. The Academy reaches approximately 700 students per year, 100 of them taking more than one class.
The fall, winter and spring quarters run eight weeks beginning in late September, late January, and mid-April. Each class meets one day a week. The Academy also runs summer camps for those going into K-12, where students come each weekday during the morning or the afternoon. The grade school summer program uses a play-in-a-week format, rendering familiar stories like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Legend of Zelda, Star Wars and The Chronicles of Narnia into simple and fun performances. For the 7-12th grade students, there are three classes throughout the summer: a two-week Musical Theatre camp, a two-week Drama camp, and a 3-4 week Musical Performance camp.
In Summer 2011 the Musical Performance camp for the students entering grades 7-12 was changed. It was originally a program focused on finding the individual talents of each actor involved and bringing them together into a fun, original musical. The program became more like a summer stock performance, where the students have 3–4 weeks of rehearsals in which to fully memorize their lines, choreography, and music. The success of their 2011 production of Footloose cemented the change in the program.
Each year, there is also a Winter Intensive for school age students to perform. The Intensive format includes a couple weeks of rehearsal each day culminating in a ticketed performance. The proceeds from the performance go toward the Scholarship Fund. Since taking over as Education Director in the Fall of 2011, Chris Taylor has also added a Spring Intensive during Spring Break for the area's schools.
Spokane Civic Theatre's Academy program also runs a scholarship program for the many students in the community who possess a love of theatre without the ability to fund a whole week at camp. Thanks to the generous contributions from the community, many scholarships have been provided to qualifying families with the over $15,000 raised per season. The community's need for scholarship has increased from approximately 10% to 30%.
Spokane Civic Theatre's Little Shop of Rentals is home to a growing collection of costumes and props. Over 10,000 costumes are currently housed in the shop, all available to be rented out to various individuals or organizations. Jan Wanless, head of Costume Design & Construction, has won numerous state, regional, and national theatre awards for the beautifully crafted and historically accurate costumes produced at Civic. The costumes available range from traditional Victorian and Edwardian dresses to eccentric character pieces, such as the Cookie Monster or the Pink Panther.
Spokane Civic Theatre has approximately 500 volunteers who serve as actors, backstage crews, front of house, house managers, and board members. They contribute an estimated 90,000 hours every year. Volunteers return to Civic time and time again, supporting the theatre's endeavors. In addition to volunteering their time, the Spokane community has given incredible amounts in the form of donations that support the theatre and its mission.
Civic provides over 600 Main Stage tickets to help various other community organizations and individuals with their auctions and fundraisers. Civic also presents 15-20 benefit performance nights for other not-for-profit groups, reaching 4,500-6,000 individuals. Many of these individuals have never been to Civic or a live stage production before.
In the fall of 2011, Civic launched the Shakespeare in Schools community outreach program. The program is free for Middle and High School students and teachers and is taught by Civic's Director of Education, Chris Taylor. Shakespeare in Schools this 2013-14 season has reached approximately 750 students and 16 teachers at 7 schools. During the fall of 2013, Taylor tested a pilot program called Creative Dramatics with the focus on Elementary school students/teachers; it received an enormous response (serving approximately 350 students, 14 teachers, and 9 schools) and will become a full program, like the Shakespeare in Schools.
For the first time in March 2014, Civic and the Spokane Symphony joined forces to present a two evening performance of the theatre's earlier hit production of Les Misérables live at the Martin Woldson Theatre at the Fox. The joint fundraiser for the three community organizations exceeded their expectations.
Spokane Civic Theatre holds approximately 150 local, state, regional, and national awards for community theatre from the Inlander's Spokie awards to the American Association of Community Theatres' (AACT) Festival.
At the 2011 AACTFest, Spokane Civic Theatre's production of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee received two awards and three nominations. The awards were for Lacey Bohnet as Best Supporting Actress and Nancy Vancil for Best Musical Accompaniment. Nominations were in the areas of Best Lighting Design, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Ensemble.
Civic has also been recognized by the city of Spokane, most recently in 2007, when then Technical Director Peter Hardie was recognized for continued artistic excellence, and Resident Director Troy Nickerson for volunteering abundant talent and resources to help raise funds for many Spokane area non-profits.
Pandemis heparana has a wingspan of 16–24 mm. In these moths the basic color of the forewings ranges from yellowish brown to reddish brown, with a reticulate pattern, a dark brown basal fascia, dark brown transversal bands, two triangular spots and brown fringes at the edge. The hindwings are gray-brown with white-yellow fringes. The larva can reach 22 mm and it is pale green.
These moths have two generations per year (bivoltine). The moth flies from late May to mid-September in western Europe. The larvae are considered a pest of trees and shrubs. They live in a rolled leaf and are polyphagous, feeding on various deciduous trees and shrubs including oak, willow, birch, honeysuckle, sorbus, apple and pear. Pupation takes places in the rolled leaves.

7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is an immunosuppressor and a powerful organ-specific laboratory carcinogen. DMBA is widely used in many research laboratories studying cancer. DMBA serves as a tumor initiator. Tumor promotion can be induced with treatments of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in some models of two-stage carcinogenesis. This allows for a greatly accelerated rate of tumor growth, making many cancer studies possible.
Kauravar (Malayalam: കൗരവര്‍) is a 1992 Malayalam crime drama film directed by Joshiy, written by Lohithadas, and starring Mammootty, Vishnuvardhan, Thilakan, Murali, Anju, Babu Antony and Bheeman Raghu.
The film was remade in Telugu as Khaidi Garu with Mohan Babu. It was also remade into Kannada in 2001 by the title Devasura and starring Devraj and B. C. Patil.
A gang led by Aliyar (Thilakan) holds a grudge against Police Officer Haridas (Vishnuvardhan) who was responsible for the death of Antony's (Mammootty) wife and daughter as well as Aliyar's Wife and two daughters 12 years ago and sent Antony to jail. When Antony is finally freed, he reunites with his old gang and they plan to kill Haridas. Antony then discovers that his daughter who he thought had died is actually still alive and was raised by Haridas as one of his daughters. Antony meets his long-lost daughter but Aliyar and gang are not ready to leave Haridas. Antony pleads to the gang to leave Haridas alone but fails to stop them. During the struggle, Antony gets shot by Aliyar and in his defence kills Aliyar.
In the climax of the movie, when Rajagopal (Murali), who was a friend of Haridas, is about to tell who is the actual daughter of Antony, he stops him saying that all the three girls are his daughters.
Blåbärssoppa (Finnish: mustikkakeitto) is a Scandinavian soup made from bilberries, which can be served cold or hot. It is sweet and contains starch, which gives it a fairly thick consistency. It is served both as soup, often together with porridge, or as a drink.
In the USA, blåbärssoppa is imported and sold under the trade name Blåbär. Blåbärssoppa can be home-made from bilberries, sugar, water and potato starch, or it can be bought ready-made or in powdered form, to mix with water.
The Swedish word for bilberry, blåbär, literally means "blueberry", but the beverage is not made from the North American blueberry (section Cyanococcus of the genus Vaccinium), but from the related but distinct bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, which grows in the wild throughout Scandinavia and other parts of Europe.
Blåbärssoppa is traditionally served to the participants at the ski marathon Vasaloppet, as it is rich in energy. Bilberries have traditionally been used to combat mild gastrointestinal ailments, and in Sweden and Finland, blåbärssoppa is often considered suitable food for people with stomach upsets, also because it is energy-rich.
Genetic significant dose (GSD), or genetically significant dose, was initially defined by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) in 1958.
It represents an estimate of the genetic significance of gonad radiation doses. Annual GSD is calculated by weighting the individual gonad doses received during ionizing imaging by the number of individual examined, and accounting for the number of offspring for each individual.
Vrbica Stefanov (Macedonian: Врбица Стефанов) (born December 19, 1973) is a retired Macedonian professional basketball player who last was a head coach of Macedonian basketball team Kožuv.
After starting his basketball career with Tikveš, Stefanov played six seasons with MZT Aerodrom (1992–1998), then passed to Rabotnički (1998–1999), Karsiyaka Izmir (1999–2000, Turkey), AEK Athens (2000–2001, Greece). He then remained for four years in Italy, in the Montepaschi Siena (2001–2005), where he reached a Euroleague Final Four.
He has won the 1998–99 Macedonian National Championship with Rabotnički, the 2001 Greek National Cup with AEK Athens, the 2002 Saporta Cup with Montepaschi Siena, the 2003–04 Italian National Championship with Montepaschi Siena, and the 2005-06 Turkish National Championship with Ülkerspor. He was also the captain of the Macedonian national team and played at the 1999 European Championship and the 2007 European Championship qualification.
On 23 March 2009, Vrbica Stefanov was awarded the Medal for Service to the Country by the then-president of the Republic of Macedonia Branko Crvenkovski in acknowledgement of his sport achievements and his contribution to developing and popularizing sport in Macedonia as well as promoting the country abroad.
The Huntington Red Devil football team first kicked off in 1982 with Jack Churchill as the first coach of many for the team. Since then, the most wins in a season is 3 total which has happened in 1985, 1992, 1999, and 2015 being the most recent. The team has yet to have seen a playoff victory more less a playoff appearance.
Dohlkuh (Persian: دهل كوه‎, also Romanized as Dohlḵūh) is a village in Alqurat Rural District, in the Central District of Birjand County, South Khorasan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 696, in 191 families.
Kiya Husayn II (Persian: کیا حسین‎), was the last ruler of the Afrasiyab dynasty, ruling from the late 15th-century till his death in 1504. He was the grandson and successor of Luhrasp.
He ruled over a large part of western Mazandaran, and districts of Firuzkuh, Damavand, and Hari-rud. During the dissolution of the Aq Qoyunlu confederation, Kiya Husayn II expanded his rule from western into central Iran, where he captured Ray and Semman. He also defeated Mohammad Hosayn Mirza, who was the Timurid governor of Astarabad. It was probably around this period that Kiya Husayn II married the Aq Qoyunlu princess Tajlu Khanum.
He later became the enemy of the Safavid shah Ismail I (r. 1501-1524), whom he may have seen as a rival for the command over the Shi'ites in Iran. In 1504, Kiya Husayn II's territories was invaded by Ismail I, who seized the strongholds of Gol-e Khan and Firuzkuh, and surrounded Kiya Husayn II in Osta, who was shortly captured. However, the latter commmited suicide—his body was burned at Isfahan in front its inhabitants, whilst his followers in Mazandaran were slaughtered. Ismail I took Tajlu Khanum into his harem, where she became his favorite wife.

Santa Rita High School is located in Groves Lincoln Park, Tucson, Arizona. The school was established in 1969. It was named after the Santa Rita Mountains, one of the mountain ranges surrounding the Tucson valley. The campus has three main two story classroom buildings where most classes are held. The school educates about 950 students from grades 9 to 12. Graduating classes usually consist of 300 students.
Most classes are held in the one, two, and three hundred buildings with few like Band, Choir, Adv. Culinary Arts, Welding, Construction, Automotive Technology, and Drama are held in other buildings. Vocational programs are held in the northernmost building of the campus.
In the summer of 2007 it was announced that Santa Rita would be hiring a new football coach, Jeff Scurran. After a 0-10 2006-2007 season, the Eagles underwent a radical transformation to an 11-2 team, falling one game short of the championship game. For the next two seasons, the Eagles went to the title game but came up short. The 2008-2009 team had a record of 12-2 and lost to the defending champions from Notre Dame Preparatory High School by a score of 30-26. The 2009-2010 team returned to the state championship with a record of 11-3, but they lost in the coach's final game at the school as Cactus High School would shut them out 14-0.
The village was developed due to the construction of the railroad in the area. The first families started to populate the area, mainly families of the railroad construction workers or their management staff.
It owes its name to the existence of a lake nearby, known for the clarity of iots water. This made the first people who arrived to build the train station to call it "the station where the clear lake is", which in time was shortened to "Laguna Limpia" (Clear Lake).
The population, according to the 2001 census [INDEC] was 1,1876 inhabitants, which more than doubled the population of 433 in the previous census of 1991.
The main road connecting the town is Provincial Route 30 (unpaved), connecting to the north with Provincial Route 3 (then to Presidencia Roca and Pampa del Indio), and to the south to Ciervo Petiso and Colonias Unidas. The other Provincial road is Provincial Route 42, connecting to the southeast to the village of Las Garcitas.
Wildkirchli (English: Wild Chapel) are three interlinked caves situated in the Alpstein massif in the Appenzell Innerrhoden canton of Switzerland, north-east of Mount Säntis Switzerland. The caves are located at a height of 1,477–1,500 m (4,846–4,921 ft). They are notable for the traces of Paleolithic Neanderthal habitation, dating to c. 40,000 BP, and cave bear bones dating to 90,000–40,000 BP. A museum at the site houses a full bear skeleton that was found in one of the caves.
There are three caves, the Altarhöhle (altar cave), the Untere Höhle (lower cave), and the Obere Höhle (upper cave), located on the Ebenalp, which is the northernmost summit of the Appenzell Alps. They sit at a height of 1,477–1,500 m (4,846–4,921 ft), and are reached by cable car from Wasserauen to the top of Edenalp, followed by a 15-minute hike down the mountain.
The earliest-known documentation of the cave was a visit by a cave explorers' club, the Höhlenklub of Appenzell, in 1863. In 1658, Paulus Ulmann (1613–1680), a priest in Appenzell, founded a chapel in the lower cave and established a hermitage in the upper cave. A series of hermits inhabited the site, and provided food and lodging to pilgrims who visited the chapel. The last hermit died in 1851, and the hermitage was eventually transformed into an inn. A small museum which is a recreation of the hermits' house was built on the site of the old inn.
The cave chapel and pilgrimage were the subject of one chapter of Joseph Victor von Scheffel's Ekkehard: A Tale of the Tenth Century, Volume II.
Many bones have been found in the caves; the hermits sold them to pilgrims. In 1903–1908, Emil Bächler discovered flint tools in the Altarhöhle. Their identification as Mousterian was the first demonstration of Neanderthal man in the Appenzell Alps. Later excavations revealed three stratigraphic layers in the Altarhöhle. The lowest layer (90,000–40,000 BP) contained primarily cave bear bones. The upper layer contained the flint tools and was dated to the final phase of the Mousterian (about 40 000 BC). The layer also contained bones from animals such as chamois, ibexes and wolves, suggesting that the caves served as summer hunting sites.
Today the caves have become a tourist destination. On the same path as the caves is the Berggasthaus Aescher, a 170-year-old guesthouse built into the cliff. The guesthouse was included as one of the four most interesting restaurants by the Huffington Post and it was featured on the cover of National Geographic's "Places of a Lifetime" publication (2015).

CW Now is a news program/news magazine series which premiered on The CW on September 23, 2007. It was a brand extension of the syndicated Telepictures news magazine Extra, and features anchors and correspondents from that show. The program was devoted to topics of interest to young adults (20-30, the audience targeted by the network), including entertainment news and technology topics.
During the upfronts, Dawn Ostroff announced a new marketing strategy for this show using what she calls, "cwickies" (pronounced quickies), which is used in this program to replace the traditional network advertisements. Tanika Ray mentions that CW Now is a 30-minute commercial-free program. Nonetheless, as comedian Lewis Black pointed out on The Daily Show on September 26, 2007, the frequent mention of Wal-Mart shows that it is the program's de facto sponsor.
On the January 20, 2008 episode, CW Now received a 0.2/0 in the 18-49 demo. The zero share was a record low for the network.

Marilyn Miller (born Mary Ellen Reynolds, September 1, 1898 – April 7, 1936) was one of the most popular Broadway musical stars of the 1920s and early 1930s. She was an accomplished tap dancer, singer and actress, and it was the combination of these talents that endeared her to audiences. On stage she usually played rags-to-riches Cinderella characters who lived happily ever after. Her enormous popularity and famed image were in distinct contrast to her personal life, which was marred by disappointment, tragedy, frequent illness, and ultimately her sudden death due to complications of nasal surgery at age 37.
Marilyn Miller was born in 1898 in Evansville, Indiana, the youngest daughter of Edwin D. Reynolds, a telephone lineman, and his first wife, the former Ada Lynn Thompson. The tiny, delicate-featured blonde was only four years old when she debuted in the role of Mademoiselle Sugarlump at Lakeside Park in Dayton, Ohio, performing as a member of her family's vaudeville act "The Columbian Trio". That act, which included her stepfather Oscar Caro Miller and her older sisters Ruth and Claire, was soon renamed the "Five Columbians" after she and her mother joined the routine. From their home base in Findlay, Ohio, the five toured the Midwest and Europe for 10 years and managed during that time to skirt the child labor authorities until Lee Shubert discovered Miller at the Lotus Club in London in 1914.
Miller appeared in New York City for the Shuberts in the 1914 and 1915 editions of The Passing Show, a Broadway revue at the Winter Garden Theatre, as well as in The Show of Wonders (1916) and Fancy Free (1918). It was, however, Florenz Ziegfeld who made her a star after she performed in his Ziegfeld Follies of 1918 in Manhattan at the New Amsterdam Theatre on 42nd Street, with music by Irving Berlin. Sharing billing with Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers and W. C. Fields, she brought the house down with her impersonation of Ziegfeld's wife, Billie Burke, in a number titled "Mine Was a Marriage of Convenience".
Miller followed as a headliner in the Follies of 1919, dancing to Berlin's "Mandy" and reputedly became Ziegfeld's mistress, though this was never proven. She attained legendary status in the Ziegfeld production Sally (1920) with music by Jerome Kern, especially for her performance of Kern's "Look for the Silver Lining". The musical, about a dishwasher who joins the Follies and marries a millionaire, ran 570 performances at the New Amsterdam. In 1921, the still-obscure Dorothy Parker memorialized her performance in verse:
From the alley's gloom and chill / Up to fame danced Sally. / Which was nice for her, but still / Rough upon the alley. / How it must regret her wiles. / All her ways and glances. / Now the theatre owns her smiles, / Sallies, songs, and dances. ...
After a rift with Ziegfeld, Miller signed with rival producer Charles Dillingham and starred as Peter Pan in a 1924 Broadway revival, then as a circus queen in Sunny (1925), with music by Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein. A box-office smash, it featured the classic "Who?", and made her the highest paid star on Broadway. In 1928, after reuniting with Ziegfeld, she starred in his production of the successful George Gershwin musical Rosalie, then in Smiles (1930) with Fred Astaire, a rare Ziegfeld box office failure.
Miller's movie career was short-lived and less successful than her stage career. She made only three films: adaptations of Sally (1929); and Sunny (1930); and Her Majesty Love (1931), with W. C. Fields. Her last Broadway show, marking a major comeback, was the innovative 1933-1934 Irving Berlin/Moss Hart musical As Thousands Cheer, in which she appeared in the production number "Easter Parade".
Miller's appearance in As Thousands Cheer was her last professional outing. She quit the show after her boyfriend and future husband Chester O'Brien – a chorus dancer who served as the production's second assistant stage manager – was fired for allowing the Woolworth department store heir Jimmy Donahue to sneak onstage during a scene in which she was impersonating his cousin, the heiress Barbara Hutton. After her death, this incident gave Irving Berlin the inspiration for a film musical, On the Avenue, for which he received a script credit in addition to writing the songs.
Marilyn Miller's last name was adopted from the surname of her stepfather, Oscar Caro Miller, while her first name was formed by combining her birth name, Mary, with her mother's middle name, Lynn. Initially calling herself Marilynn, she would drop one "n" at the urging of Florenz Ziegfeld.
Census records document very few dozen people named "Marilyn" in the United States in 1900; by the 1930s, following Miller's stardom, it was the 16th most common first name among American females.
In the late 1940s, Norma Jeane Baker (née Mortenson) changed her name to Marilyn Monroe at the urging of Ben Lyon, a one-time actor turned casting director at 20th Century Fox, who said she reminded him of Miller – he had played Miller's love interest in Her Majesty, Love. Monroe would "become" Marilyn Miller herself when she married the playwright Arthur Miller in 1956.
Frank Carter, an actor and acrobatic dancer, whom she married on May 24, 1919 at the Church of the Ascension in New York City. He was killed in a car accident in Cumberland, Maryland, on May 9, 1920. He was portrayed by Gordon MacRae in the Miller biopic Look for the Silver Lining and by Walter Willison in Ziegfeld: The Man and His Women.
Jack Pickford, an actor and the brother of film star Mary Pickford, and also a drug and alcohol abuser. They were married in 1922, separated in 1926, and divorced in Versailles, France, in November 1927. She had attempted to secure a divorce in the Paris courts in the spring of 1927, but her published comments about how easy it would be to end her marriage in France "stirred the ire of the Paris Tribunal with the result that the court would take no action on Miss Miller's petition". She filed for divorce the following July in the nearby city of Versailles, whose tribunal eventually ended the marriage.
Jack Donohue, a dancer who went on to become a successful director and choreographer in theater, films, and television. He should not be confused with Jack Donahue, who appeared with Miller in Sunny and Rosalie.
Chester O'Brien, a chorus dancer, whom Miller married on October 4, 1934, in Harrison, New York. Several years older than him, she reportedly spent more than $56,000 on him during their brief time together. He, who later was known professionally as Chet O'Brien, went on to become a stage manager for such Broadway productions as Brigadoon and Finian's Rainbow. He also was the stage manager and an actor on Sesame Street from the premier of the show in 1969 until 1992.
In 1930, Miller was briefly engaged to Michael Farmer, who later became a husband of Gloria Swanson. In 1932, she announced her intention to marry Don Alvarado, but the wedding did not take place.
Miller had a long history of sinus infections, and her health was compromised by an increasing dependency on alcohol. According to reports shortly before her death, she entered a New York hospital in early March 1936 in order to recover from a nervous breakdown. Three weeks later, however, she developed a toxic condition and died from complications following surgery on her nasal passages at age 37 in New York City on the morning of April 7, 1936 and was given a funeral at Saint Bartholomew Church on Park Avenue which drew 2,500 people, including former mayor Jimmy Walker, Beatrice Lillie, and Billie Burke.
The procession led to Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, where Miller was buried alongside her first husband Frank Carter in a mausoleum she had constructed to house his remains.
A statue of Miller, in the title role of Sunny, can still be seen atop the former I. Miller (no relation) Shoe Company Building at 1552 Broadway, also addressed as 167 West 46th Street, in Times Square, Manhattan. It is one of four sculpted by Alexander Stirling Calder between 1927 and 1929 for the building's facade, representing famous theatrical professionals of the time. In 2013, after years of neglect, the building and statues were restored.
In 1949, a sanitized biopic, appropriately titled Look for the Silver Lining, starred June Haver as Miller. She was also portrayed by Judy Garland in Till the Clouds Roll By, MGM's biopic of Jerome Kern. In 1978 the story of her tempestuous relationship with Ziegfeld was portrayed in the Emmy-winning made-for-TV biopic Ziegfeld: The Man and His Women, starring Pamela Peadin as Miller, Paul Shenar as Ziegfeld, and Walter Willison as Frank Carter. Rare film footage of Miller in the 1929 film version of Sally can also be seen in the 2004 PBS documentary series Broadway, the American Musical.
In the only published biography of Miller, The Other Marilyn (1985), author Warren G. Harris describes her as "Ziegfeld's most dazzling star" and the premier musical comedy star of the Jazz Age. He adds, "She had rivals who may have been better dancers, singers, actresses, or mimics, but no one individual could equal her when it came to combining all those talents."
All three films survive in some form, but Sally, filmed entirely in two-color Technicolor, now exists only in black-and-white, except for one fragment – most of the "Wild Rose" musical number – that has survived from an original Technicolor print.

Techno Mart refers to either of two different shopping malls in Seoul, South Korea. The Gangbyeon branch, located in Gwangjin District, contains an estimated 2000 electronics and appliances stores. The Sindorim branch is located in Guro District.
On 5 July 2011, the top 19 stories of the 39-story building housing the Gangbyeon branch of Techno Mart shook violently for 10 minutes and was evacuated for two days. After study, it was determined that 17 people performing Tae Bo exercises to "The Power" in a 12th floor fitness center caused the building to vibrate by creating a mechanical resonance. The tentative conclusion was the consensus among the six professors from an architectural institute and vibration measurement experts who participated in a recreation of the event. The Architectural Institute of Korea was scheduled to release the final results of the safety inspection later in 2011.

George Shaw (6 March 1877 – 24 March 1954) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Born in Stroud, Gloucestershire, Nelson started his career at Cheltenham youth club FC Battledown. He also played for the Cirencester College Football Academy team, under the management of ex-Wales international Steve Lowndes. County Cup success led to him being spotted by Northern Premier League side Hucknall Town after a spell with Doncaster Rovers. Nelson joined Brentford from Hucknall in February 2004 for a fee of £10,000. He completed his first full season with Brentford in 2004–05, maintaining 21 clean sheets and helping the team into the promotion play-offs.
Nelson was appointed club captain for the 2006–07 season and scored the decisive penalty in a League Cup first round shootout win over Swindon Town. However, a ligament injury picked up in October meant that he was unable to play again until 2007. He returned and played 6 games towards the end of the season.
He was released by Brentford on 16 May 2007. He signed for Leyton Orient in summer 2007, but left less than a year later by mutual consent due to relocating issues. On 1 August 2008 Norwich City confirmed the signing of Nelson after he impressed Glenn Roeder while on trial at Carrow Road. He was released at the end of his one-year contract the following summer having made no first team appearances.
On 23 June 2010, he signed a two-year contract with League One team Notts County. Upon his signing for Notts County, he became the first choice goalkeeper; a position he retained in the 2011–12 season. However, on 9 May 2012, he was released by Notts County along with 12 of his teammates.
On 20 July 2012, Nelson signed for Football League Two side Gillingham on a free transfer, on a two-year deal. He made his debut for Gillingham on 18 August 2012 against Bradford City. In his first season with the club Nelson won the League Two title and was runner up at the Player of the Season awards.
He received the club's player of the year award for the 2013–14 season. In May 2014, Nelson signed a new two-year contract, and in June 2016 signed a further two-year contract with the club. He made his 200th start for the team in December 2016.
Eupogonius affinis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It was described by Stephan von Breuning in 1942. It is known from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.
The 1936 Orange Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game between The Catholic University of America Cardinals and the Ole Miss Rebels from the University of Mississippi on January 1, 1936, in Miami, Florida.
The Cardinals opened their season with four consecutive victories and ended with a record of 7-1. In the course of the 1935 season they had three shutouts, gave up only 34 points, and did not allow a rushing touchdown.
The Rebs also began with a series of victories, including a 92-0 blowout against the Memphis Tigers in the second game. They finished with a record of 9-3.
On the trip from D.C. to Miami, the Cardinals were on the same train as Earl Carroll's "Vanities girls." Carroll, known as "the troubadour of the nude", was famous for his productions featuring the most lightly clad showgirls on Broadway. Coach Dutch Bergman put his team under "martial law," fearing his players and the showgirls would "dance their football game away before they played." The experience was enough to make Bergman vow to never accept another Bowl bid, but he did, four years later, when the Cardinals played in the 1940 Sun Bowl.
The very first King Orange Jamboree Parade was held the day before the game with 30 floats at an expense of $40,000 ($653,933 in 2012 dollars). Babs Beckwith was chosen as the first Orange Bowl queen.
There was little interest in Miami before the game, as indicated by sluggish ticket sales and few bets placed. Despite this, CUA was predicted to win "by the smallest of margins."
Pete Dranginis, the Cardinals' quarterback, threw a one-yard pass to Bill Adamaitis in the first quarter to give the team an early 7-0 lead. In the second Adamaitis threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to Stuart "Stee" Foley, making Adamaitis the first of only three players to catch and throw a touchdown pass in the same Orange Bowl. In that same quarter the Rebels got on the board when quarterback Ned Peters scored on a 67-yard run. The score stood at 13-6 at halftime.
In the third quarter Mississippi's Dave Bernard attempted a punt, but the Cardinals' entire right side broke through the line and center Joe Yanchulis blocked the kick. Backup end Ferdie Rydzewski recovered the ball and ran for a 20-yard touchdown to bring the score to 20-6. The Rebels scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, but missed the point after attempt on the first. The first, run in by Ole Miss fullback Dave Bernard, was the first rushing touchdown the Cardinals allowed all season. This late game rally "kept 10,000 fans howling," but the final score was 20-19, Cardinals.
George Mulligan, a Cardinal, tore ligaments in his leg during the third quarter, and "Irish" Carroll, described as the Cardinals' "chief scoring hope" going into the game, didn't have a point attached to it after the final whistle.
After the game, the Cardinals were inundated with fans seeking autographs at the Hotel Flamingo and "a heap of telegrams" of congratulations poured in from around the country. In the days that followed, the Cardinals celebrated by sightseeing in Miami, going deep sea fishing, and going to dog races as the guest of Tiny Parker.
The Cardinals returned to Washington on Sunday, January 5. A crowd of 3,000 greeted them at Union Station, and when the train pulled in the crowd let up a cheer that, according to the Washington Post, "must have caused serious disturbances on the Georgetown scismograph."
A parade including 300 cars, the U.S. Navy Band, the Washington Boys Club Band, and many foot marchers brought the team from Union Station up Pennsylvania Avenue, to Connecticut Avenue, and from there to Rhode Island Avenue and back to the CUA campus. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, "on his way to church, became an unwitting parader, when the march de triumph jammed traffic in front of the White House."
A crowd of 1,000 greeted the players when they returned to campus and mass was celebrated in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception for them by Maurice S. Sheehy, assistant rector. A bonfire was also held that evening.
A "victory dinner" was held to honor the Cardinal players on February 3 at the Willard Hotel. After awards and certificates were presented, a special radio broadcast on NBC ran from 10:00 to 10:30. The night concluded with dancing.
In attendance were "Washingtonians from all walks of life, representatives of the national and District governments, local businesses, professions, and clubs." District Commissioners George E. Allen, who served as toastmaster, Melvin C. Hazen, and Col. Daniel I. Sultan were in attendance as were the chairmen of the Congress' District of Columbia committees, Senator William H. King and Representative Mary Teresa Norton. Others included members of the Mississippi Congressional delegation, the presidents of Georgetown University and the University of Maryland, members of Congress and the executive branch, and local notables. To promote the event, the team was met on the steps of the DC Municipal Building by several of the district's commissioners a few days before.
Seven members of the Cardinals were of Lithuanian descent, including Captain Ed Karpowich. Povilas Zadeikis, the Lithuanian government's representative in the United States, and members of the Lithuanian Society of America were on hand to greet the team when it pulled into Union Station and presented the seven players with certificates of merit at a banquet held a few weeks later.
He was born in Paris, France, the son of Georges Constantine Louis Raynaud, who was an engineer, and Virginie Marie Billet. His parents moved to Brussels, Belgium when he was two years old, and his mother died there when he was only five years of age. He studied at several schools, and attended the Université Catholique de Louvain where he graduated as a mining engineer in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. Although he grew up and studied in Belgium he would return to his native France in his early twenties. [he returned to France when he was released from the army, in 1940. This data is registered in the military files.In 1941, he met Louise Baudin to whom he was married in 1944, and with whom he travelled to America, in 1947].
At an early age, Dr. de la Ferriere showed interest in psychology and conducted para-scientific investigations. He also investigated man's relationship with the universe, ancient cultures, linguistics, philosophy, medicine, theology, parapsychology, esoterism and metaphysical studies.
During World War II, Dr. de la Ferriere returned to France worked as a psychologist and began his research into the sciences of astronomy and astrology.
As Yoga continued to persist as the central point of his interest, Serge, without discarding his responsibilities, public activities, or scientific investigations, slowly began to partake in various initiations within the science and ancient tradition of the Great Rishis and Yogis of India and Tibet.
In 1946, he obtained a doctorate in Natural Medicine During this same year, as President of the International Federation of Scientific Societies, he asked
the French Government to financially sponsor a research expedition to study the ancient civilizations of South America; his request was denied.
On November 12, 1947, Dr. Serge left Europe and traveled to the American Continent. He arrived at New York City and established the first center for the Universal Great Brotherhood. The Universal Great Brotherhood was created as a non-sectarian, and non-religious establishment, and all philosophies, religions, and cultures are studied with impartiality and preference is held towards none.
After passing through Guatemala, he arrived in Caracas, Venezuela, on January 17, 1948 with the goal of establishing it the headquarters of the institution. Once the center for the Universal Great Brotherhood in Caracas was well established, Dr. Serge found a beautiful spot in El Limón, Maracay, in the State of Aragua, Venezuela where he decided to construct an Ashram. Here he gratuitously offered an education to the public which encompassed the study and practice of ancient traditional teachings with the purpose of spiritual, artistic, and mental development. He also established an Initiatic College, Esoteric Center, and Study Center free of charge, as well as a Meditation Center, and Yoga Institute together with Jose Manuel Estrada, co-founder.
In Venezuela Serge met his first and most notable disciples and descendant masters: Jose Manuel Estrada, Juan Victor Mejias and Gil Colmenares ("Elder Brothers"). It is primarily these three disciples who are responsible for establishing the basic principles and structures of the Universal Great Brotherhood, which is a public institution, and the Supreme Order of Aquarius, which is the internal esoteric group that contains several streams and approaches to the establishment of these principles.
In 1949, after a stay of 17 months in Venezuela, he traveled to New York to preside over the International Peace Conference held in the month of June. [In New York, he separated from his wife and was taken to court by her, but they never actually got divorced]. From there he departed to Asia through Brussels and France.
He established a center for the Universal Great Brotherhood in Algiers, Africa and registered the Universal Great Brotherhood, Dr. Serge Raynaud de la Ferrière Foundation with the United Nations DPI (Department of Public Information) in 1949 and met his disciple David Juan Ferriz Olivares after that by letters.
The Universal Great Brotherhood is a member of the United Nations ECOSCOC (Economic and Social Council) and has Consultative Status as of the year 2000.
Serge visited 43 countries establishing the Universal Great Brotherhood and its branches, which include Study Centers of Universal Wisdom, Ashrams, Initiatic Colleges, Institutes for Perfectionment, Yoga Institutes, Social Services, etc., while also giving more than 2,500 lectures and workshops to Universities, Medical Faculties, Rotary Clubs, the Red Cross, The French Alliance, Cultural Center, Public Schools, Churches, Freemasonry Temples, Rosicrucian Chapters as well as Theosophical Society Chapters. [Yet, although he visited many countries, the Brotherhood and some of its ramifications exist in more or less 25 countries, mostly Latin-American, which were not necessarily the ones he visited. For instance, the UGB doesn't exist in the East, and in Europe it only operates in Spain, Italy and Norway].
He was accepted and received everywhere with enthusiasm. He presented a clear and well-balanced teaching, both scientific and metaphysical, neither predominantly orientalist or occidentalist. His teachings were many and varied and included Buddhism, The Bible, Philosophy, Ontology, Geophysics, Cosmobiology, Meta-Astronomy, Medicine, and Hermetic Science.
Upon returning to Europe he stopped dressing in white, settling down in Nice, France. He began to write The Psychological Proposals, Volumes 1 through 36, with the help of this secretary and partner, Catherine Cucchietti and his 61 circular letters. By this time he had already written the books : The Great Messages, Yug, Yoga Yoghism, Art in The New Age, and The Black Book Of Freemasonry, with black signifying the color of gunpowder. He died in Nice.
Elder Brother Jose Manuel Estrada had this to say about the book published by the Drs estranged wife. "Every Spiritual teacher has a Judas".
Val Dean Rust (born November 28, 1934) is a professor at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Rust was born into a family with roots in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In the early 1960s, Rust taught high school in Murray and Salt Lake City, Utah.
Rust attended Brigham Young University and then received his Ph.D. in education from the University of Michigan in 1967. He did research at Deutsches Institut für Internationale Pädagogische Forschung in Frankfurt, Germany and postdoctoral studies at the University of Oslo in Norway.
In his time at UCLA (1969–2008), Rust has been faculty chair of the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, director of the International Education Office, and associate director of CIDE. He has also served as a guest professor at institutions such as Padagogische Hochschule in Freiburg, Germany, Khazar University in Baku, Azerbaijan, Humboldt University of Berlin, and the University of Oslo; He has received Honorary Doctorate from Khazar University.
His professional service includes key positions with the Comparative and International Education Society (Board of Directors 1979-82; President, 1990–91); the Higher Education Special Interest Group (founding Co-Chairperson, 2008-2013); and the scholarly journal Comparative Education Review (Associate Editor, 1998–present).
In addition to his scholarly contributions, Rust is also co-founder and associate director of UCLA's Center for International and Development Education (CIDE). CIDE, founded in April 2002, serves as a hub for researchers and organizations from a wide range of disciplines. The center’s mission is to provide quality information through a series of publications, research programs and practical initiatives. CIDE engages in educational development projects around the world in areas such as teacher education, higher educational change, educational finance, and international educational leadership. Though he technically retired in 2008, he continues to work with incoming doctoral students as an academic advisor and with CIDE.
In November 2013, Rust was the target of a protest claiming that microaggressions were common in the culture of UCLA. Approximately 25 students, many representing Students of Color, staged a sit-in in Rust's classroom and stated that they objected to his writing of grammatical corrections on assignments. Rust said he was committed to "being rather thorough" with graduate students. Rust was defended by former students and also other members of Students of Color.
Rust has been a major contributor to the field of comparative education for more than 45 years, authoring and co-authoring more than 100 books and articles. His primary research interests include the politics of education reform, the role of education in broader social change, and internationalizing higher education.
His diverse body of work includes: The Unification of German Education (1995), The Democratic Tradition and the Evolution of Schooling in Norway (1989), and Alternatives in Education: Theoretical and Historical Perspectives (1977). Rust has also given a number of lectures emphasizing the relevance of postmodernism to the field, most notably his 1990 presidential address to the Comparative and International Education Society and his 2004 Eggertsen Lecture, titled "Postmodernism and Globalization: The State of the Debate."
In 2004 Rust published Radical Origins: Early Mormon Converts and Their Colonial Ancestors through the University of Illinois Press, which examined his own Mormon lineage and its relationship to the radical early American religious culture.
The Senate House Libraries (formerly The University of London Research Library Services) was a group of libraries based in Bloomsbury which together comprised an extensive research collection across the humanities and social sciences. It existed under this name from 2011 to 2013.
SHL was a division of the University of London, headquartered at Senate House on Russell Square, and was formed by bringing together the former University of London Library (now Senate House Library) and the libraries of the various institutes comprising the School of Advanced Study. The previous umbrella name, University of London Research Library Services (ULRLS) was replaced by Senate House Libraries on 1 April 2011 in a rebranding exercise.
The combined holdings of the libraries amount to almost 3 million volumes, including many thousands of journals, and numerous deep and rich collections of research materials in subjects across the disciplines.
The Senate House Libraries group was dismantled in 2013; in 2014 Senate House Library joined the School of Advanced Study. There are now four independent libraries in the School of Advanced Study: Senate House Library and the libraries of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, the Institute of Classical Studies, the Institute of Historical Research and the Warburg Institute.

At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, American singer Lady Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef, which was commonly referred to by the media as the meat dress. Designed by Franc Fernandez and styled by Nicola Formichetti, the dress was condemned by animal rights groups, and named by Time as the top fashion statement of 2010.
The press speculated on the originality of the meat dress idea, with comparisons made to similar images found in contemporary art and popular culture. As with her other dresses, it was archived, but went on display in 2011 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after being preserved by taxidermists as a type of jerky. Gaga explained following the awards ceremony that the dress was a statement about one's need to fight for what one believes in, and highlighted her distaste for the US military's don't-ask-don't-tell policy.
Gaga was the most nominated artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, "If we don’t stand up for what we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights[,] pretty soon we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones." "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. "But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?"
Fernandez was approached by fellow designer and stylist Formichetti to produce the dress, with it planned out over the course of a week, Formichetti having styled the look. The dress was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts to ensure that the dress kept well. Flank steak was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.
Fernandez said of his design, "I knew the dress would be one of other amazing pieces Gaga wore that night. It's very well made and looked great on her, on and off camera. We didn't get a chance to have a fitting. The only time she had it on was for the VMAs. Only when I saw it in the monitor did I know it would be big."
Fernandez reporting Gaga's opinion in an interview said that Gaga herself said it smelled good, because it smelled like meat. The designer talked of what was to happen to the dress after the awards show, "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, and it will be a different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid $6,000 to taxidermist Sergio Vigilato to preserve the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor once it was defrosted. It was treated with bleach, formaldehyde and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so to give it the same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.
Previously, she had worn a bikini made of meat on the front cover of the Japanese edition of Vogue. It was originally worn by Gaga at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards to accept her award for Video of the Year. Although it was Gaga's third costume change of the evening, the meat dress was immediately described as "most outrageous fashion moment" of the evening.
Fernandez credits the dress with an upturn in his career, saying, "I feel like I have a voice now as an artist and as a designer". He had previously created items for Gaga, including a costume for her music video for "Bad Romance". He went on to create a hat that Gaga wore to the 53rd Grammy Awards in February 2011.
During Halloween in 2010, re-creations of the meat dress were popular in New York City, and in 2011, a group of students from the University of Cumbria made a re-creation of the dress with the help of local butchers. The dress went on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in 2011 as part of an exhibition entitled "Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power".
A poll by website MyCelebrityFashion.co.uk placed the dress as the most iconic outfit of 2010, beating Kate Middleton's engagement dress into second place. In summing up 2010 through a series of lists, Time voted the meat dress as its top fashion statement of 2010.
When "Weird Al" Yankovic did a parody of Gaga's "Born This Way", titled "Perform This Way", he included a lyrical reference to the meat dress ("I strap prime rib to my feet / Cover myself with raw meat / I'll bet you've never seen a skirt steak worn this way") and had a dancer dressed in a similar outfit in the music video.
Following the VMAs, media outlets attempted to analyse the meaning of the dress with suggestions by BBC News ranging from anti-fashion, to feminism, aging and decay, and society's attitude towards meat. Chef Fergus Henderson explained this meat attitude as "People often don't want meat to look like meat. They want it to be neatly wrapped in plastic from a supermarket." People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said "wearing a dress made from cuts of dead cows is offensive enough to bring comment, but someone should whisper in her ear that more people are upset by butchery than are impressed by it." The Vegetarian Society also condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said "No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal. Enough animals die for food and they should not be killed for stunts like this."
Another controversy surrounding the dress was the question of its originality. Brooks Barnes of The New York Times wrote that the dress was "derived" from Incarnation, a painting of a white-haired girl wearing a meat dress by artist Mark Ryden. Sharon Clott of MTV also noted the similarity between Gaga's dress and Ryden's painting. Ryden was reportedly upset that Gaga did not acknowledge that she took inspiration from his work. Some in the art and fashion press remarked on the dress' similarity to Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic, a meat dress made by Canadian sculptor Jana Sterbak in 1987 exhibited to considerable controversy at the National Gallery of Canada in 1991. Karen Rosenberg from The New York Times compared the dress to a series of photographs of Francis Bacon posing with sides of beef attached to his torso like wings in 1952, while The Daily Telegraph compared the dress to the original cover of The Beatles' 1966 album Yesterday and Today, and noted its similarity to the cover of the November 1983 The Undertones album All Wrapped Up, which showed a female model wearing a dress and gloves made of cuts of meat (mostly bacon) held in place with plastic wrap and a sausage necklace. Architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had also designed a meat dress in 2006. An earlier example of a garment made from meat stitched together in the same way as the Lady Gaga meat dress was worn at the Slade School of Art postgraduate degree exhibition opening in London, England in July 1979, when performance artist Robert Connolly wore a two-piece suit made of slices of salami.
Some media sources proposed that the dress could be interpreted as anti-vegan. Vegetarian singer Morrissey stated that he felt the dress was acceptable as long as it was a social or political statement, and not just a "loony idea", pointing out that artist Linder Sterling had previously worn a meat dress in 1982 to protest against what she believed to be the perception of women by men. Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, "... it has many interpretations. For me this evening, if we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon, we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. And, I am not a piece of meat." She explained further that she was also using the dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.

Born Claude Berel Langmann in Paris, Berri was the son of Jewish immigrant parents. His mother, Beila (née Bercu), was from Romania, and his father, Hirsch Langmann, was a furrier from Poland. His sister was the screenwriter and editor Arlette Langmann.
Berri won the "Best Film" BAFTA for Jean de Florette, and was also nominated for twelve César Awards, though he never won. Berri also won the Oscar for Best Short Film for Le Poulet at the 38th Academy Awards in 1966, and produced Roman Polanski's Tess which was nominated for Best Picture in 1981.
Internationally, however, two films in 1986 overshadow all his other achievements. Jean de Florette and its sequel Manon des Sources were huge hits. In 1991, his film Uranus was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. Six years later, his film Lucie Aubrac was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival.
In 2003, he was elected President of the Cinémathèque Française where he obtained enough state subsidies to cover the costs of its resurgence at its new site in the rue de Bercy.
Berri's wife, Anne-Marie Rassam, committed suicide in 1997, jumping from the apartment of Isabelle Adjani's mother. Berri and Rassam had two children: actor Julien Rassam and actor and film producer Thomas Langmann.
Berri died of a stroke on 12 January 2009, aged 74. After his death, a group of nine works by Robert Ryman, Ad Reinhardt, Giorgio Morandi, Richard Serra and Lucio Fontana was promised to the Centre Pompidou in Paris in lieu of tax. But the heirs of the film director finally sold them through French art dealer Philippe Ségalot for about €50 million to Qatar.

Abbie Burgess Grant (1839–1892) was an American lighthouse keeper known for her bravery in tending the Matinicus Rock Light in Maine during a raging winter storm in 1856. She did so for nearly a month while her father, the head keeper, was away from the island. Her heroic actions attracted much attention and she was soon a popular heroine.
Abbie Burgess was the fourth of nine children of Samuel and Thankful (Phinney) Burgess, who moved with his invalid wife, a son, and several daughters to Matinicus Rock in 1853 to become its lighthouse tender. Although only 15, she soon took over duties of tending the lighthouse so that her father could fish and catch lobster, which he sold in Rockland, Maine, 25 miles (40 km) away. In the lighthouse, she found a lightkeeper's log, which detailed great storms that had struck Matinicus Rock, including one in 1839 that had destroyed the original lighthouse.
The family lived in a home near the new lighthouse, and Abbie became concerned that if a gale came, that the home could be damaged, and her mother would be unable to be moved. In December 1855 she transferred her mother's bedroom to a small room in the lighthouse itself. Less than a month later a devastating gale struck.
In January 1856, Samuel Burgess left Abbie, his wife, and her younger sisters to take care of the lighthouse while he went to obtain supplies in Rockland. The lighthouse cutter that was supposed to have supplied the family had not shown up for its September delivery, and food and oil for the light was running low. He feared that the family might be stuck on the Rock throughout the winter with no supplies. He charged Abbie with the care of both her family and the lighthouse.
Almost as soon as he had left, the wind shifted and a gale began. It blew for three days, with waves so high they overran the island with knee-deep water. The home intended for the family was completely washed away. Abbie and her sisters had to secure the windows of the lighthouse to keep the waves from breaking them in. The lower level flooded, and they were forced to seek refuge in the north lighttower. Abbie even managed to rescue all but one of their chickens. Throughout this ordeal she kept the lighthouse light burning.
Even after the gale subsided, the waves were too treacherous for her father to return for another three weeks. The family subsisted on one cup of corn meal mush and one egg per day until Samuel Burgess was able to return with supplies.
Samuel Burgess lost his position as lighthouse keeper in 1861 for not supporting Abraham Lincoln. (At the time lighthouse keepers were presidential appointees.) He was replaced by Capt. John Grant. Abbie Burgess, however, stayed on to train Grant and fell in love with his youngest son, Isaac. They were eventually married, and she and Isaac served as assistant keepers on Matinicus Rock for fourteen years, where they had four sons. They were then moved to Whitehead Light off St. George, Maine, where they served as lighthouse keepers for fifteen years before retiring in 1890.
Abbie Burgess died in Portland, Maine in 1892. Maritime historian Edward Rowe Snow located her grave in Forest Hills Cemetery in South Thomaston, Maine and in 1945 arranged for a memorial in the form of an aluminum scale replica lighthouse to be placed over her grave.
Burgess is the subject of several books, including the children's books Keep the Lights Burning, Abbie by Peter Roop, Connie Roop, and Peter E. Hanson and Abbie Against the Storm by Marcia Vaughan and illustrated by Bill Farnsworth.
The folk song "Lighthouse Keeper" by Neptune's Car was inspired by the experiences of women lighthouse tenders including Ida Lewis, Katherine Walker, and Abbie Burgess.
In 1998, the United States Coast Guard commissioned Cutter Abbie Burgess (WLM-553), a 175' Keeper-class buoy tender. She is currently stationed in Rockland, Maine.

Huarmey is a coastal town in the Ancash Region, Peru. It is one of the five districts and also the capital of the Province of Huarmey. It is located crossing the Pan-American highway from south to north after leaving the department of Lima in Paramonga and at 82 km from the Fortaleza river. It was created by law 24034 on December 20, 1984.
At certain times of the year, the settlers fish abundant and flavorful shrimps in the Huarmey River. This river fertilizes the valley and flows from south to north.
This city is not very well developed yet, but it is one of the main cities of the Ancash Region and one of the most impressively attractive too. Huarmey has its own beautiful beaches that do not have anything to envy to the other beaches of the country. It is a very nice place to camp, practice surf or just take a refreshing splash in its beaches. The most important disadvantage is that the water is very cold, in spite of the high temperatures of the city, all the year round.
The Honda TR200 series of bikes was produced only in 1986 and 1987. The engine was a 199 cc four-stroke OHC single linked to a five-speed transmission and automatic clutch. It featured lever actuated drum brakes on both wheels. This bike was unique in that it used two ATV-type tires. Presently complete bikes are quite uncommon, though replacement parts are readily available as they interchange with other Honda ATCs.
